One thing I\u0027ve coonsidered is flipping it on its head and putting the process up front and having the rationale follow it. That way people who just care about the process have it immediately available, but for those that care about it, the rationale is still there.\n\nThat said, the breadth and depth exists because the proposed process didn\u0027t emerge in a vacuum. The proposed process exists because I wrote down the background and thought about the impacts.",

I\u0027d honestly be sort of inclined to make it much more nebulous, maybe something like \"if a subproject\u0027s maintainers have been consistently unresponsive or excessively slow to respond for a period of at least ~3-6 months\".  The openness to interpretation of course leaves us potentially vulnerable to people being overly aggressive in petitioning the TOF, but my (optimistic, perhaps naively so) inclination would be to let people use their judgement -- if a particular individual becomes an excessively frequent complainant we can ask them to dial it back.  If we get flooded with complaints we can perhaps revisit the policy to raise the threshold for lodging one, but to hazard a guess I\u0027d expect that complaints will likely remain infrequent enough that it wouldn\u0027t be problematic for the TOF to address them case by case, even if they don\u0027t all result in any actual maintainership changes.",

So I suppose it\u0027s a matter of weighing that risk against the risk of people being too quick to escalate.\n\nPersonally I think I\u0027d still lean toward a \"vague and flexible\" definition over a rigidly-defined one (we\u0027ll know if we hit the bad case because the signal is obvious, whereas it\u0027s harder to notice if people are silently having real trouble and not escalating).",

I think that\u0027s vague enough that there\u0027s some discretion there, but requires that someone establishes and defends the position that a pattern exists. I think the TOF can establish the existence of a pattern based on a complaint without requiring the complainant do all the legwork. It should be easy enough for the complainant to make a claim about the existence of a pattern which is then established by the TOF as part of validation of the complaint. If the complainant wants to supply all the evidence as well, then that\u0027s a bonus (less work for TOF members).",

If maintainers are responsive enough not to fall afoul of the proposed cap of 3 consecutive months then really it\u0027s a matter of discussing onboarding others with them when they are responsive. If they\u0027re not engaging in that discussion in good faith that\u0027s when we may need to take further action. I think if maintainers are not engaging in the project in good faith it calls into question their continued presence in the community, which is a problem with broader scope than just their role as maintainer. Such behaviour is actively detrimental rather than just an inability to meet the community\u0027s need for progress.\n\nThe proposed 3 month cap is a bound to define it cannot be argued that you\u0027re not unresponsive as a maintainer, and justifies community action to mitigate it without further input as a means to avoid deadlock. In that context, taking action when people are even only intermittently responsive starts to feel like overreach.",

I was thinking in terms of the TOF measuring backwards after the three non-consecutive periods of unresponsiveness, determining the violation and immediately taking steps to on-board a new maintainer. By changing the wording to three warnings rather than three instances of inactivity there\u0027s no opportunity to remove maintainers without actively trying to engage them.\n\nI\u0027ll leave a bit of time for this to simmer in the comments and then I\u0027ll update the wording if there\u0027s no significant opposition.",

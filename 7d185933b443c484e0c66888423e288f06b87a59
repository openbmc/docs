For example, it may not be written if BMCWeb dumps, BMC crashes, etc.  If we are going to store a sequence of PrivilegeRegistry PATCH requests, I think the file needs to be written when the PATCH request is being processed.\n\nInstead of writing a sequence of PATCHes, can BMCWeb instead simply write the new PrivilegeRegistry to a file?",

Because, I can today set health of Fan using OperationalStatus\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/redfish-core/lib/processor.hpp#L76\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/redfish-core/lib/sensors.hpp#L801\n\nIs the proposal to streamline all those -or- add the hooks of OperationalStatus into all the other schemas like Assembly , PCIeSlot, the new Fan and PS and others ?",

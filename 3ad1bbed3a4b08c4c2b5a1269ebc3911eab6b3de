It has come from the downstream device query which is going to map to one of the descriptors, isn\u0027t it?\n\n\n\u003e \"Identifier\": \"CPLD_0\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Similarly for components:\n\u003e \n\nI have mapped it only to Component Identifier in case of component.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \"/xyz/openbmc_project/software/SW_CPLD_0\"\n\u003e \"Identifier\": \"SW_CPLD_0\"",

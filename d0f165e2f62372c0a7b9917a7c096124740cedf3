      "message": "Section \"13.4.4.4 Redfish OAuth2.0 scope usage\" of the spec allows this to be a comma separated list of roles or privileges. \n\nIMO, having a list of roles is an undefined operations. As an example, I don\u0027t really know what a scope like \"Redfish.Role.ReadOnly, Redfish.Role.Operator\" would entail. My guess is that it would allow the union of both ACLS, but maybe that\u0027s a question for DMTF.\n\nDoes this design change much if we only allow roles in the scope, or is that not too serious of an issue?",

To address my questions on in PS3 I think it would be more useful if it said something like your reply to my comment:\n\n\"The tag allocated through a call to `sendto()` or `sendmsg()` on a connected socket is subject to the same invalidation logic as on an unconnected socket: It is expired either by timeout or by a subsequent `sendto()`.\"",

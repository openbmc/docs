I\u0027m not going to review it further until I see motion from others in the community that this is really a direction people want to go.",

      "message": "Hi @abhilash.kollam@gmail.com - Thanks for putting together the new design document. I noticed that it’s quite similar to the one you had previously shared here: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/docs/+/67077. Is this different than that ? Would it be possible to continue updating that same review instead of creating a new one? Keeping the discussion in a single gerrit commit helps preserve the existing comments and context, which makes it easier for everyone to follow along without having to revisit everything from scratch. It also saves time for reviewers and ensures the feedback history is not lost.\n\nAlso, if you’re looking for potential consumers of your library, it might be a good idea to share this on the mailing list. That way, it can reach a wider audience in the community beyond just the reviewers you’ve added, and you may get more useful feedback and interest.",

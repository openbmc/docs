      "message": "So far it has little focus on the Redfish Host Interface object.   The original proposal focused on how BIOS would use a Bootstrap account enabled by the interface to discover information to advertise in SMBIOS, and the pending changes Redfish has recorded for the BIOS.   Additional discussions have explored more how the Bootstrap accounts would be managed.  \n\nAs stated below\n- There is additional information needed to implement the Redfish HostInterface object, \n- I believe the Bootstrap account design needs more focus. (I\u0027m ok with a separate section in this design but would also accept splitting it into its own design)\n- I suggest caution about using a bootstrap account and Redfish to obtain and process the information proposed.",

I believe (without any code review) that the repository only exposes existing state and exposes methods to add/update objects it manages - users for `passwd` entries.

But this is adding additional state and management and initiating changes on system events a much more active role and business logic.\nÂ \nIf we support disabling the network by patching the interface Disable or creating isolated networks, there are service targets to stop or start.

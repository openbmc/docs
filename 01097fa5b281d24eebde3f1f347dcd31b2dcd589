      "message": "1. This sensor exists today in dbus-sensors, and has quite a bit of state for handling power state, fans that are dual rotor, and sensor error conditions.  Handling all those states properly in a generic case here would be difficult, if not impossible.\n2. This seems like a specific case that ADCSensor could simply have added to its implementation.  The current ADC sensor takes \"Index\": 0 to define which input to use, \"DiffIndex\": 1 could be added as an optional parameter to support differential mode.  In this way, for the ADCs that actually support differential measurement, ADCSensor can do that in the ADC preamp hardware, instead of relying on software.  In the proposal you\u0027ve given, you\u0027re locked into software only, and you will have unintended noise skew between samples when the readings change rapidly.  Double check with your hardware engineers if back to back samples are clean enough to be compared, and they didn\u0027t intend for you to use the differential mode.\n3. You haven\u0027t defined any integral operators, or defined how you would time bound them for what you would need that to do power consumption measurements from a current monitor.  With that said, I think that\u0027s much better done in code, in the relevant daemon that already knows the sample rate, and can update the value much more accurately.  Also, considering this would likely need to persist somewhere to be accurate between bmc reboots, again, the virtual sensor daemon seems like the wrong place to do doing that.\n4. (trying to remember thermodynamics class from college)  Yep, energy transfer from a flowing liquid is a 3rd order transfer function of the flow rate.  Of all these cases, this seems like the best fit for something like this proposal, but it seems easily solved in code with a declaration of 3 coefficients, as well as sensor names in a config file.  If you did that it would be, better documented (in code), and easier to debug.\n\nFor what it\u0027s worth I think adding code to the appropriate place is much easier in the long run (and more efficient).",

I\u0027m not sure how you\u0027d properly handle error states, or power states on any of these sensors.\n\nAmithash\nI\u0027m not following?  Many ADCs (BMC and non BMC alike) have a built in differential mode, that generally takes 2 adjacent GPIO bank pins, and turns them into a single ADC differential channel.  I\u0027m not recommending you change your hardware, just that you use the ADC the way its intended, rather than relying on the timing of 2 independent samples.\nIf your IC ADCs aren\u0027t capable of that mode, it\u0027s still valid, as other ADCs might have that mode, so we don\u0027t want to duplicate the \"how to do a differential measurement\" code in 2 places.  Also, done in the ADC sensor, in the case where your IC doesn\u0027t support it, it can be sure to synchronize the two ADC channel scans to reduce the skid between them.",

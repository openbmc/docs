      "message": "I\u0027m perplexed why this is helpful and necessary.\n\n1. We have some dbus applications that use \u0027sd_bus_default\u0027 and some which use \u0027sd_bus_system\u0027.  This is a problematic inconsistency in our codebase to begin with because depending on which user is running the application you end up with a different bus choice, and in some cases segmented busses between applications.\n\n2. There should be no issue with running the system bus _inside_ the Docker container because it is still its own bus.  Why can\u0027t entity-manager operate on the container\u0027s system bus?",

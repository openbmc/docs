Why do we need to define a new dbus interface?  \n\n\nIt seems like you\u0027re describing:\n\nu-boot -\u003e new daemon -\u003e entity-manager -\u003e dbus inventory objects.\n\nWhy not cut entity-manager out of it and just make the dbus inventory objects directly? (maybe this belongs in an alternatives)\n\nAny reason why we couldn\u0027t make the same arbitrary-ish interface that FruDevice makes?  Unfortunately that interface is also not-documented, but we could fix that.  Most of these fields you\u0027ve listed already have analogs in IPMI.",

If we rely on generated headers, that\u0027s no longer the case.\n\nConsidering we currently have 2 different bindings and 1 preference for manual, this isn\u0027t really the case today.  At least the bindings are mostly self-consistent.\n\nEven if you scope to the manual implementations, this isn\u0027t strictly true.  Taken dbus-sensors:\n\n```\n$ rg \"xyz.openbmc_project.Sensor.Threshold\" -l              \nREADME.md\nsrc/Thresholds.cpp\n```\n\nSo, no I can\u0027t find all cases where thresholds are created because we\u0027ve created a \"library\" or \"utility function\" (or one might say \"manually created binding\") so now I also have to find all the cases where _this_ is used.\n\nThe code is just as \"greppable\" when it comes to the bindings, in my opinion (also in dbus-sensors).

I don\u0027t really want to regress there either.  So, yes, my preference would be if we want to use a new language, someone invests the time in generating a binding generator.\n\n\u003e Do we require generated headers and constants for interfaces provided by projects such as systemd or the mctp userspace?\n\nI\u0027m fine with us going either way on those, but my preference would be to tend towards using a binding.  Someone added `phosphor-dbus-interfaces/yaml/org/freedesktop/UPower/Device.interface.yaml` so that they could use the bindings against it, so there\u0027s no reason you can\u0027t make bindings against non-OpenBMC interfaces.",

      "message": "I think this update does not answer how the host details can be passed via the IPMI LAN Messaging. The suggestion from Vernon is whether we can use LUN in the IPMI LAN packet to pass the host information. You seem to focus on adapting netipmid to fit the multi host scenario, which is probably not needed.",

This design is similar to the ipmbbrige where we use a ipmb bus Id to get the host details. In the same manner the netipmid can get the host details from any one of the listed approaches.

Please let me know if I am missing something.\n\nnetipmid instances are run typically per ethernet interface. Do you mean to run different instances of netipmid? If so, how does each instance forward host information to the ipmi daemon? \n\nAtleast for me this section is vague, it will need a block diagram and some more details on how the host information is forwarded by netipmid (instance/instances) to ipmid just like how ipmbbridged forwards the host specific information to ipmi daemon.",

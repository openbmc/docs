      "message": "Yes, the below config is for probing on the newly detected fan board.\n\nIt probes on the \n```\nxyz.openbmc_project.Configuration.GPIODeviceDetected\n```\ndbus interface.\n\nI\u0027m not certain this is the right name for the interface though.\n\nBecause the prefix\n```\nxyz.openbmc_project.Configuration.\n```\nis usually meant for configuration.\n\nBut also an inventory interface is not right, since the inventory should be exposed by entity-manager. The presence daemon does not need to know the type of device.\nSo it should not expose an inventory interface.\n\nBut i am also not certain that it\u0027s ok to just make up dbus interfaces without going through pdi (unless it\u0027s \u0027xyz.openbmc_project.Configuration.*\u0027 namespace).\n\nSo i chose the dbus interface as seen in the probe statement below.",

Nothing is jumping out at me at the moment though.\n\nIt is a form of inventory i guess. We have detected a device for in the inventory but it is unclear which one it is. It has a name which can be used to activate the probe the actual entity with entity-manager.\n\nSent the question on discord, since i also had some other queries about some pdi interfaces that do not have properties defined. Maybe someone has an idea, otherwise i can just adjust the design to use the proposed interface \n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775381525260664832/1273263354647023616/1285254113344622614",

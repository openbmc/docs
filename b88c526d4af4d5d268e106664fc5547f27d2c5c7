      "message": "I think this patchset moves close toward the main idea which I comprehend to be:\n\u003e This is a way to add SELinux to your OpenBMC image so you can run SELinux in permissive mode to can collect SELinux event logs.  The logs are need to create SELinux policies with the intention of eventually enabling  SELinux controls, and some test cases will help generate the logs, but anything beyond enabling SELinux so logs can be collected is beyond the scope of this design.\n\nBut I would like to see that more clearly.  IMHO, all other intentions should be dropped from this design document.  The main idea (above) is enough.\n\nAlso I think the document should be re-worded to be read for the point of view of someone reading it after it was already merged into openbmc/docs.  I\u0027ve pointed out (in review comments) some places where the language is from the point of view of someone trying to implement this.",

My understanding of the `chosen` node is that it\u0027s sort-of a convenience node to communicate an administrative policy choice for booting the system. For reference, the [devicetree specification](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/releases/download/v0.3/devicetree-specification-v0.3.pdf) says this in 3.5 `/chosen` Node:\n\n\u003e The `/chosen` node does not represent a real device in the system but describes parameters chosen or specified by the system firmware at run time.\n\nThe information you\u0027re proposing to embed in `chosen` here sound a lot more like concrete \"facts\" about the hardware. To me they feel like they should go elsewhere. Perhaps you can provide some specific examples of the information you plan to store in the `chosen` node to help us understand whether it\u0027s appropriate?\n\nFor instance, if what you\u0027re exposing is information like the platform class, revision, serial number, and other related data, then perhaps the kernel\u0027s `soc_device` subsystem can help:\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/sys_soc.h?h\u003dv6.6-rc6\n\nWe expose some bits and pieces for Aspeed SoCs:\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/soc/aspeed/aspeed-socinfo.c?h\u003dv6.6-rc6\n\nThis yields the following on an Aspeed AST2600:\n\n```\nroot@ast2600:~# grep . /sys/devices/soc0/*\n/sys/devices/soc0/family:AST2600\n/sys/devices/soc0/machine:AST2600 EVB\n/sys/devices/soc0/revision:A3\n/sys/devices/soc0/serial_number:0932ba2112109613\n/sys/devices/soc0/soc_id:05030303\nroot@ast2600:~# \n```\n\nA useful escape hatch for any other properties might be via `custom_attr_group`:\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/sys_soc.h?h\u003dv6.6-rc6#n18\n\nIn terms of implementation you might map the reserve memory specified in the devicetree and parse your data out into the `soc_device` attributes.",

Linux has extended this to store phandles (references to other nodes in the tree) in several defined properties (eg, linux,stdout-path vs stdout), and devicetree.org has extended its definition to be \"chosen by system firmware\".\nhttps://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/blob/main/source/chapter3-devicenodes.rst#chosen-node\n\nHowever, the information parsed in your board fixup is all hardware information and should be placed according to standard bindings.\nhttps://github.com/HewlettPackard/gxp-uboot/blob/5aa47dcfa086fdde8093baa55fa0586e5b0ef56d/board/hpe/gxp/gxp_board.c#L249\n\nmac_0 and mac_1 should be placed in the driver nodes as local-mac-address.  U-boot had code to set the eth\u003cn\u003eaddr envionment variables to the associated device tree entries (which I expect may set mac-address).\n\nhttps://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/blob/main/source/chapter4-device-bindings.rst#local-mac-address-property\n\nSimilarly, there are standard properties for model and serial-number \nhttps://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/blob/main/source/chapter3-devicenodes.rst#root-node\nwhich should probably be assigned to the root node.   I don\u0027t know what the pca is but having a device node representing it with its part number and serial would be expected.  (Note: I just read Andrew\u0027s comment about the soc device generic driver, which makes sense for hardware registers).\n\nIf you want to expose the raw blobs with their crc consider something like a /firmware node or sub-node describing specific stores (roms / images).",

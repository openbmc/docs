As a point of organisation, if you think you\u0027ve resolved a problem identified in the comments please make sure to tick the `Resolved` checkbox so they can be hidden from view on subsequent revisions. I\u0027ve marked a handful of comments as resolved.\n\nOn the content, I think we\u0027re converging on a reasonable design. There are still some bits left to work through though. Let me know what you think of some of the ideas.",

For reference, the [devicetree specification](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/releases/download/v0.3/devicetree-specification-v0.3.pdf) says this in 3.5 `/chosen` Node:\n\n\u003e The `/chosen` node does not represent a real device in the system but describes parameters chosen or specified by the system firmware at run time.\n\nThe information you\u0027re proposing to embed in `chosen` here sound a lot more like concrete \"facts\" about the hardware.

Perhaps you can provide some specific examples of the information you plan to store in the `chosen` node to help us understand whether it\u0027s appropriate?\n\nFor instance, if what you\u0027re exposing is information like the platform class, revision, serial number, and other related data, then perhaps the kernel\u0027s `soc_device` subsystem can help:\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/sys_soc.h?h\u003dv6.6-rc6\n\nWe expose some bits and pieces for Aspeed SoCs:\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/soc/aspeed/aspeed-socinfo.c?h\u003dv6.6-rc6\n\nThis yields the following on an Aspeed AST2600:\n\n```\nroot@ast2600:~# grep . /sys/devices/soc0/*\n/sys/devices/soc0/family:AST2600\n/sys/devices/soc0/machine:AST2600 EVB\n/sys/devices/soc0/revision:A3\n/sys/devices/soc0/serial_number:0932ba2112109613\n/sys/devices/soc0/soc_id:05030303\nroot@ast2600:~# \n```\n\nA useful escape hatch for any other properties might be via `custom_attr_group`:\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/sys_soc.h?h\u003dv6.6-rc6#n18\n\nIn terms of implementation you might map the reserve memory specified in the devicetree and parse your data out into the `soc_device` attributes.",

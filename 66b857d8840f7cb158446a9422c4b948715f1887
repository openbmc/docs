I see some discussion on it above but I never really see the decision explicitly written.\n\nIt looks like from this you decided to do split busses?  Is that necessary; does it provide advantages?  It seems a bit awkward to me and a lot of extra work in the console server to maintain N independent bus names.  Generally we shouldn\u0027t be relying on bus names for process separation anyhow, so I\u0027m not really sure what it buys us.",

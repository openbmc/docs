      "message": "Probably should\u0027ve addressed this in my earlier comment, however: I\u0027m not sold on the suggested path under `${XDG_CACHE_HOME}`. Why `data/`? Everything that can be cached is data. And why `bitbake.downloads` and `bitbake.sstate`? It\u0027s fine to nest directories.\n\nI\u0027d suggest recommending `${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/bitbake/downloads` and `${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/bitbake/sstate`, however, as this is all just recommendations, people are free to make their own choices anyway, so I\u0027ve marked this resolved.",

      "message": "This isn\u0027t the only approach that works - for instance I set it in my (fish) environment:\n\n```\nset -gx DL_DIR /var/cache/bitbake/downloads\nset -gx SSTATE_DIR /var/cache/bitbake/sstate\nset -gx BB_ENV_PASSTHROUGH_ADDITIONS \"DL_DIR SSTATE_DIR\"\n```\n\n`BB_ENV_PASSTHROUGH_ADDITIONS` specifies the variables `bitbake` should allow from the calling environment.\n\nSetting the variables in the shell environment means the shared cache works across multiple build directories without having to edit `local.conf`. Maybe that\u0027s worth mentioning?",

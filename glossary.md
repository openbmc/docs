# Glossary

Guidelines:
 - Include terms specific to the OpenBMC project, OpenBMC reference
   platforms (like OpenPower or ASpeed), BMCs, or platform management.
 - Include terms needed to disambiguate.  For example, "image" may refer to
   a visual (e.g., JPEG) image or a firmware (e.g. UBIFS) image.
 - Treat acronyms the same as terms.

BMC - Baseboard management controller.  A device designed to enable
remote out of band management access to a host, generally a computer
system.

Phosphor - Informally designates elements designed for use across many
systems, as distinct from platform or vendor-specific elements.

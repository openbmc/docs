# Glossary

Guidelines:
 - Terminology in scope:
   - Terms specific to BMCs, the OpenBMC project, OpenBMC Reference
     platforms (like OpenPower or ASpeed).
   - Terms needed to disambiguate.  For example, "image" may refer to
     a visual (e.g., JPEG) image or a firmware (e.g. UBIFS) image.
 - Do not include widely-known terms.
 - Treat acronyms the same as terms.

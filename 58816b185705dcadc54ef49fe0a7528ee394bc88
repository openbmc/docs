      "message": "Happy to have that discussion if we think there\u0027s a better alternative for hosting this.  My thought process here is that pretty much all other alternatives that I ran through were worse than just a shared repo in OpenBMC.\n\nMy requirements are largely to put this somewhere that:\n1. Has an existing CI setup.\n2. Has an existing code contribution and leadership model for Apache2 software.\n3. Has coding standards we can code to.\n4. Is a recognized authority such that we can pull this into both an EDK2 build as well as an OpenBMC build.\n\nMy immediate thoughts for orgs were essentially this list:\n\nArm gitlab\ngithub.com/edtanous/libcper\ngithub.com/Nvidia/libcper\ngithub.com/DMTF\ngithub.com/tianocore/edk2\nlinux Kernel\n\nBut each of them fails at least one of the requirements above, except OpenBmc, hence why I landed on this design doc.",

Who determines what is \"decoded\" and what isn\u0027t?\n\n\nIn terms of the justification for the library, I figured this was enough.  I expected that the answer to \"how decoded is decoded\" is decided as we develop the repository;  I intentionally made it vauge because what exists only implements basic struct level unpacking of errors and mapping to strings.\n\n\n\u003e  Aren\u0027t there almost always details at a hardware level that only the original vendor has?\n\nThat might be true depending on how secret a vendors implementation is, but is there something we can do in this design that make that more clear?\n\n\u003e \n\u003e How does `libcper` on its own satisfy this?  Does it just generate a string?  This is probably out of scope for now, but it seems like we need some way to eventually populate a LogEntry in Redfish?\n\nYes, for sure, and I think I wrote exactly that later on in the doc;",

The requirement is that the code can be shared in EDK2, so if there\u0027s a way to make this code fit that requirement that isn\u0027t written in C, I didn\u0027t want to preclude it in the requirements.\n\n\nFull disclosure here, I\u0027m part of the oreboot org, but I have no designs for trying to get this code shared with oreboot.\n\nThe intent behind oreboot is to use rust, so that seems incompatible at a library level with EDK2/OpenBMC.  If there\u0027s a way to write this design that includes oreboot, and there\u0027s interest from oreboot maintainers, we can certainly get this section amended.",

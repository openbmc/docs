I also have some reservations around putting libcper under the OpenBMC org given its utility to other projects[^1], but given it needs to be hosted somewhere, I\u0027m not against it either.\n\n[^1]: libmctp and libpldm could also live outside the OpenBMC org",

      "message": "Happy to have that discussion if we think there\u0027s a better alternative for hosting this.  My thought process here is that pretty much all other alternatives that I ran through were worse than just a shared repo in OpenBMC.\n\nMy requirements are largely to put this somewhere that:\n1. Has an existing CI setup.\n2. Has an existing code contribution and leadership model for Apache2 software.\n3. Has coding standards we can code to.\n4. Is a recognized authority such that we can pull this into both an EDK2 build as well as an OpenBMC build.\n\nMy immediate thoughts for orgs were essentially this list:\n\nArm gitlab\ngithub.com/edtanous/libcper\ngithub.com/Nvidia/libcper\ngithub.com/DMTF\ngithub.com/tianocore/edk2\nlinux Kernel\n\nBut each of them fails at least one of the requirements above, except OpenBmc, hence why I landed on this design doc.",

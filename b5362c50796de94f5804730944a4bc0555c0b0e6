      "message": "I don\u0027t see anything here to require logging of sudo operations.  If all we\u0027re doing is requiring someone to insert \u0027sudo\u0027 in front of \u0027sudo /bin/bash\u0027, this is a whole lot of work for nothing in my opinion.  We should have a requirement in the design that all \u0027sudo\u0027 operations are logged to journal/syslog.\n\nI would also suggest that we consider prohibiting \u0027sudo \u003cshell\u003e\u0027 operations rather than allowing all commands, so that we get better logging on what is being ran and the logging isn\u0027t subverted by someone running \u0027sudo /bin/bash\u0027.",

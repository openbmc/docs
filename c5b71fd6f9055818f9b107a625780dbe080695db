      "message": "Can we get a dbus interface to represent a UPS?  I don\u0027t think we should tie this design exclusively to the phosphor-power implementation (which effectively nobody else uses).\n\nThere are already pretty decent support in Linux off-the-shelf for UPSes using the \u0027UPower\u0027 package.  Ideally we should find a way to interoperate with this.  I gave an output of the dbus interfaces provided by UPower for my desktop, which has a small USB-connected UPS on it.\n\n1. https://upower.freedesktop.org/docs/Device.html\n2. https://gist.github.com/williamspatrick/011941640a3d84753a935197403aa637",

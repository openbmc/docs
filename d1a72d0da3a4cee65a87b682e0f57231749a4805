      "message": "From the discord conversation:\n\n\u0027\u0027\u0027\nI think the options are between:\n1. Objects don\u0027t exist until the backend is prepared to handle them (in which case they don\u0027t appear in Redfish)\n2. If a user tries to do something that you\u0027re not in the proper state for, return an error code. (in which case bmcweb will transform into a retry-after and preconditionfailed message)\n3. If a user tries to do something you\u0027re not in the proper state for, queue it until it can be processed, which is the most user friendly (the thing you asked for just happens, response code is 200 OK, but the action might not happen the moment you asked for it.)\n\n... \n\nand I\u0027m kind of of the opinion that we push that to the power-control daemons themselves to decide.\n\u0027\u0027\u0027\n\n(off discord)\n#1 in bmcweb, the implementation for, and we have to do regardless (the power state interfaces might not exist).\n#2 is maybe 3 lines of code extra to add the message and set the return code, and we have to agree on a dbus response code for \"not yet ready\" which seems doable.\n#3 is the most user friendly, and bmcweb only has to implement the golden path.\n\nThe ideal priority would IMO be #3 (because it\u0027s most user friendly) then #1 (because the user is required to check for an action anyway, and presumably handle the error), then #2 (which requires the most sophisticated client implementation).\n\nOnce we have that, it\u0027s on each system to decide what it can and can\u0027t do in its backend, and the redfish tree is correct and standards compliant in all cases.\n\nOne thing to consider is that we have multi-host coming, and it seems likely that there\u0027s one host thats backend services fail, while the others don\u0027t.  Being flexible here means we can in those cases pick the best possible implementation the backend is able.\n",

Early startup apps have different behavior based on the chassis and host states so being able to just read these properties early in the BMC boot allows them to make their needed logic decisions. They don\u0027t necessarily need the ability to change the state, just read it.

      "message": "This leads into your next question. I think there are two options here. Either we have a clear way to tell the user when the required BMC services have started and the system can be powered on, or we go with what you\u0027re leaning towards which is we queue up the request from the user, have the required services block around the target you indicate here, and have it power on once the services are done.\n\nThe issue I have with the queue option is that what happens when the services never complete? Or one fails and the BMC gets stuck in the Quiesced state (which is what started this whole design for IBM). We don\u0027t want to try and power on if a critical service has not started or failed, and we have no way to asynchronously tell the caller we\u0027ve failed and will not be honoring their queued power on request. This design is leaning towards just failing the call and letting the user deal with the retry/error handling logic because they\u0027re going to know the behavior they want best. Otherwise what do we say to the clients? Make the request, start some arbitrary timeout, and wait for the system to actually power on? What do they do when the timeout hits? It just seems more clear to give them a \"NotReadyToBoot\" error code at the time of the request.",

Conveying \"sorry, no can do\" via an LED seems a lot more tractable (though the implicit \"try again in a minute or two\" is admittedly non-obvious).\n\nThis is of course completely tangential, but it seems like a lot of the problems we\u0027re grappling with here would be substantially reduced if we solved the long-standing \"OpenBMC takes way too long to boot\" problem (though it\u0027d need to be a pretty dramatic improvement I suppose).",

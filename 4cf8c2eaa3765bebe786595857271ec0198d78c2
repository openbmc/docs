      "message": "There is no specific vendor, I am just speculating. Even with the bmcweb call, a vendor needs to develop against the full end-to-end flow with bmcweb, image manager and their item updater. What I\u0027m saying here is that the vendor can easily develop and test their implementation without the full workflow. They should still test the whole workflow before sending for review, but this API could just make development easier.",

This design is attempting to simplify that.\n\n\nSome immediate possible users include:\nNvme, which supports updating over nvme-mi\nVRs, which have an i2c based update API\nPossible integration with fwupd, which already supports a ton of devices.",

      "message": "\u003e Can you elaborate on this?  I don\u0027t understand how \"a process that holds a bunch of files that you might want to update\" has any complexity.\n\nThe current implementation of dbus interfaces is hard to implement (I can say that from experience, because I\u0027m the person that implemented it for Redfish in bmcweb.)  It requires the use of the filesystem, and dbus in tandem with match expressions to do what is essentially an RPC operation (Update using this content), but now requires the client to track a lot of state.  It also causes bugs like: https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/issues/202\n\nBecause it requires clients to store the state of the transaction in progress. (yes, we could fix it so it doesn\u0027t seg fault, but short of writing the match information to persistent data before shutdown, there\u0027s no way to make the interface \"correct\").\n\n\u003e  You need to figure out how to get files into the BMC in order to do your update, don\u0027t you?  We already have all the Redfish plumbing for that.\n\nThe Redfish plumbing is:\nA. Brittle (see aforementioned bug) and cannot support multiple components being updated in parallel.\nB. Hardcoded for specific use cases and slots.  It cannot be extended on dbus without Redfish patches for each individual use case.\nC. Only supports updating the BMC itself.  Moving the design to support BIOS, VR, and other firmware updates using the existing interfaces would be non-trivial.\nD. Different in design principals than how we handle basically anything else on dbus.  For all other things we enumerate the interfaces available, and when we have user data available, we do a method call to send the data to the daemon that we are interacting with.  These days we support fd, so we can still use a \"file\", it\u0027s just a lot easier if that transaction happens on dbus, because we have well-trodden ways to handle dbus method calls, and very few \"wait for thing to exist\" dbus use cases.\n\nThis is a case where having a second supported API for \"new stuff\" (while still keeping the old APIs for the existing) would be to our benefit, even though I dislike the duplication, the hope is that we can eventually get rid of the old API entirely (especially given there\u0027s only one implementer) but that requires time and effort (that I am personally willing to invest in, and I think others like justin are as well).",

I believe bmcweb already does this by default.\n\nA problem this new API is trying to solve is for firmware upgrades without Redfish, where some local process within the BMC is coordinating the firmware upgrade. In that case (and even in the case of Redfish SimpleUpdate) I don\u0027t see the use for the ImageManager, when the image can be passed directly to the ItemUpdater.",

That\u0027s one of the big things being avoided.\n\nWith that said, Adriana is right here, there should be something in the alternatives section, even if it\u0027s just \"keep the current API\"",

As the maintainer of the primary application that I suspect this is targeting (ie Redfish) I\u0027m ok with maintaining two implementations of this for a time, and they should be relatively separable given the current code stack.  That also gives us a chance to prove out the new interfaces meet the needs without blowing up the old (no need to burn the ships).

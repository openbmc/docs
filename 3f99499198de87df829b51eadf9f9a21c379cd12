I was thinking of a new RestrictionMode\u003dSetupAccess which: \n(1) requires users to set up their credentials (at least: remove the default password) before they can leave that mode, and\n(2) does not let the user do anything else, including other provisioning.\nHowever, it seems like the present design (21195) is not the same as what I am thinking.

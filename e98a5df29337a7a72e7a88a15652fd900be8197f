      "message": "Two concerns here:\n\n1. We\u0027re trying to define a class of things based on single instance of such a thing\n2. Any input GPIO is an indicator\n\nI understand where you\u0027re trying to go here, so I\u0027m not trying to be disingenuous or argumentative, I just want to make sure we\u0027re doing something reasonable. There have been lots of words spent in the past arguing down similar suffixes. Can we come up with a crisp definition of what it means for something to be an indicator of a past event rather than an indicator of a current event so people know when *not* to use this category?\n\nFor instance, is `-record` any better? I feel it might give a better translation of it capturing something that\u0027s happened in the past.",

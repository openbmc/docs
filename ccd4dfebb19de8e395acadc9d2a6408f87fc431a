      "message": "I don\u0027t agree that its not supported. I already provided 2 solutions via our discord conversation earlier -\n\n1. Multipart PLDM Image with Target List supplied - BMCWeb sends the image to individual updater backends by using the Target List (invoked using Update Interface). Based on relevant component descriptors, backends will process the image.\n2. Multipart PLDM Image with no Target List supplied - BMCWeb can discover all update interfaces and send the image to all updater backend. If the backend can parse the image and the package contains the image applicable to it (based on descriptor), it will process it, otherwise it would be dropped.\n\nSo, i think you have to specifically state why above doesn\u0027t work for you which clarifies why you are looking for a different solution.",

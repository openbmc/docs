Also I expect some devices may not be made public, so this would make it more maintainable; there is no need to maintain any downstream patches.\n\nIMO, the mechanism for modularity that we already have here is dbus, because we have a well defined way to define APIs, and maintain some semblance of a stable API over time.  Adding yet another avenue for plugins would have to answer lots of new questions about how we\u0027re going to maintain and extend it over time that I\u0027m not sure we have answers to.\n\n\u003e - The sensor reading logic is already deferred to hwmon sensors, so the firmware install logic would have a similar level of abstraction.\n\nWe \"defer\" to hwmon because it has a lower level of access, and has a stable, well defined ABI that we can rely on over time.  We didn\u0027t invent it ourselves.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I originally decided to go with systemd units because that is how the ItemUpdater is implemented in phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt.

So far as I\u0027m aware, those service files don\u0027t expose a proper redfish interface.\n\n\n\nAs another example of something that systemd targets don\u0027t have a handle on is the idea of progress.  There\u0027s no way to transfer some progress percentage, and expose the dbus progress API for redfish to consume and supply to the user in this scheme.  If it\u0027s built into psusensor (or ADM1266daemon depending on how much of the code is device specific) exposing that interface in a future patch series becomes trivial.",

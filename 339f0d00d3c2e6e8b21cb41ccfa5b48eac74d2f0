What is the overall data path?  user -\u003e Redfish -\u003e bmcweb -\u003e DBus is pretty clear, but presuably that needs to go Dbus -\u003e Some daemon? -\u003e Hardware?  And I think the righthand side of that graph is important.  Presumably we\u0027re not going to run hypservisors on the BMC.\n\n2. This should call out how this interacts with other existing services.  Do composed systems show up as an Item.System?  Are there associations to the existing Item.Dimm/Item.Drive resources to map the composed resources?  How does Reset work?\n\n3. Do we need to complete the multi-host design first, so that we can enumerate multiple System instances?  I would expect the answer is yes.\n\n4.

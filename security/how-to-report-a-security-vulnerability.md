# How to report a security vulnerabiilty

This describes how you can report an OpenBMC security vulnerability
privately to give the project time to address the problem before
public disclosure.

The process is:
 - Send an email to `openbmc-security@lists.ozlabs.org` with details
   about the security problem such as:
   - the version and configuration of OpenBMC the problem appears in
   - how to reproduce the problem
   - what are the symptoms
 - The OpenBMC security response team will respond to you and
   coordinate community activity to address the problem.  Activities
   may include:
    - privately engage community members to understand and address the
      problem
    - coordinate workarounds and fixes with you and the community
    - coordinate announcement details with you
    - create an OpenBMC security advisory

Please note this mechanism is intended only for security problems that
you want fixed before public disclosure.

Alternatives:
 - If the problem is not severe, please write an issue.
 - If you are unsure if the error is in OpenBMC (contrasted with
   the Linux kernel or a customized version of OpenBMC), please
   report it and we will help you route it to the correct area.
 - Discuss your topic in other OpenBMC communication channels.

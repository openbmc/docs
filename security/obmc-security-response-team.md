# The OpenBMC security response process

The OpenBMC security vulnerability reporting process is designed to
give the project time to address problems before public disclosure.

Vulnerabilities reported through (TODO: create the "How to report
security vulnerabilities" web page and link to it here) will be
handled in private by the OpenBMC security response team.  Once the
scope of the vulnerability is understood, the security team will
privately engage members of the community as necessary to resolve the
issue.  When the issue is resolved, the vulnerability and available
mitigation will be announced.

Note that the OpenBMC security response team is distinct from the
OpenBMC security working group which remains completely open.


## Guidelines for the security response team

TODO: Record guidelines for the security team; areas to include:
 - interactions with the submitter, contributors, and other stakeholders
 - coordinate with upstream and downstream projects, including vendors
 - Get onto http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros
 - the process for information embargo and announcement

# The OpenBMC security vulnerability reporting project

The OpenBMC security vulnerability reporting project gives a way for
people to report security problems in a way that gives the OpenBMC
team time to address the problem before public disclosure.  The main
idea is the OpenBMC security team handles the problem in secret,
engaging members of the development community as needed, until the
problem is addressed satisfactorily.

Note that the OpenBMC security team is distinct from the OpenBMC
security working group which remains completely open.

The primary elements of this project are:
 - A web page that describes the project (this web page).
 - A web page that says how to report security issues privately to the
   OpenBMC security team and what tol expect.  (TODO: Create the web
   page and link to it from here.  The initial mechanism is an e-mail
   list with membership limited to one email address per Technical
   Steering Committee member.)
 - Guidelines for the OpenBMC security team in handling issues


## Guidelines for the security team

TODO: Record guidelines for the security team; ideas:
 - interactions with the submitter, contributors, and other stakeholders
 - Wish list: coordinate with upstream and downstream projects
 - the process for information embargo and announcement

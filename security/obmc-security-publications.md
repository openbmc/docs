# OpenBMC Security Publications

This document contains all the security-relevant source material
that must be addressed in the BMC's user manuals.

Reference: Common Criteria Part 3, Guidance Documents (AGD).

The practices described here are critical to protecting the BMCs security.
It was developed (TO DO: is being developed) systematically from an evaluation
of the security threats facing the BMC.
In particular, from the OpenBMC Protection Profile.

Typical user manuals cover the BMC's lifecycle from product selection, 
configuration, installation, and usage.
They might include:
 - marketing materials (with security claims)
 - installation and configuration guide
 - administrator's guide
 - operator's manual
 - Guide to servicing the OpenBMC

This type of material is sometimes presented
in terms of security best practices.
See, for example,

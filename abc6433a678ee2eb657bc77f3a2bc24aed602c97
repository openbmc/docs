It was heavily discussed with @spinler@us.ibm.com (EM Maintainer) on https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/docs/+/75500/comment/c8ef7c62_9eb33e40/. Based on discussion we went with implicit ServiceNames (based on device names) for pre/post conditions.\n\nIf you still have some questions around the EM configuration use, please reply on https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/docs/+/75500/comment/c8ef7c62_9eb33e40/ and we can open that comment thread for further discussion. It has good context and history.\n\nI will mark this comment as resolved for now.",

Reset the device after the update using GPIO pin reset.\n\nCan `Device Name` be chassis object name?

PreUpdate.service\n2. Component 1 update\n3. Component 2 update\n4. Component n update\n5. Postupdate.seervice",

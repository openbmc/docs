[Insert fact about rust here]

## Requirements

This document will cover two different rust support dbus binding to see which one we want to expierment with more in OpenBMc
- rustbus
   - https://docs.rs/rustbus/0.6.0/rustbus/
   - Test code in `rustbus-test/`
- dbus-rs
   - https://docs.rs/dbus/latest/dbus/
   - Test code in `dbus-rs-test/`


**Please note:** I am bad at rust and still learning. This is just some experiemntal to see which one we like better

      "message": "Actually, after doing some more surveying, I think it could be feasible to use Meson for the build system, and build Rust code in existing repositories alongside C++. I forgot that QEMU just made an example of this within the last 2 months. Let me experiment a little more and revise this.\n\nI also checked the `meson.bbclass` recipe and I see it has support for configuring the Rust toolchain, so I should check if Yocto can build meson projects with Rust and Cargo-wrap subprojects.",

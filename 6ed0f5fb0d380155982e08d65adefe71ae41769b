      "message": "This requirement is limiting the use case. We should not do the aggregation into one single value, but rather show the update status for each component. How aggregation is going to help you? So, lets say you have 5 components and if your progress is 50%, how do you know which progressed or not? Similarly, if Activation failed, how do you know for which failed. Also, in redfish we need to report the status and progress of each target.",

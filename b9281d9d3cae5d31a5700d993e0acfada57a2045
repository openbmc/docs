I thought we could review the code here for now. If you feel this implementation doesn\u0027t belong in this location, please let me know how you\u0027d prefer to proceed.\n\nThanks!",

      "message": "I understand that the docs repo isn\u0027t the intended destination here, but I am not sure this is an effective way to get consensus on the new code proposed.\n\nWhat we *do* want in the docs repo is a proposal for the layout of the new SPDM infrastructure. Things like:\n\n - what are the main interfaces exposed?\n - what is the requester/responder structure?\n - what parts of SPDM does this intend to support?\n - how are applications that use these interfaces typically structured?\n \nThere are very few related references to SPDM in the docs repo, perhaps we can define the design before reviewing code?",

      "message": "@ratankgupta31@gmail.com @hosmanechinmay@gmail.com - This is not the correct way to contribute within the OpenBMC community, and your recent actions are inconsistent with the community\u0027s established guidelines and expectations.\n\nSpecifically:\n1. You initiated 1:1 conversations with Google rather than using the OpenBMC mailing list, which goes against our principles of open and transparent collaboration.\n2. You did not participate in earlier community discussions about SPDM on Discord.\n3. If your intention was to contribute existing downstream code, the appropriate course of action would have been to engage earlier. Waiting until someone else raises the topic and then stepping in undermines the collaborative nature of the project.\n4. Now, by attempting to push your downstream code `here`, you\u0027re further disregarding the guidelines \u0026 wasting everyones time. Every one knows that NVIDIA has some downstream spdm daemon.\n\nDuring last week\u0027s Technical Oversight Forum (TOF), it was unanimously decided that an SPDM repository will be created, and Patrick and I will serve as maintainers for it.\n\nYou are welcome—and encouraged—to contribute your code once the repository is properly set up. Going forward, please adhere to the OpenBMC community guidelines. We expect open communication, community alignment, and proper process—not behavior that sidesteps established norms and wastes the community’s time. Let’s avoid a repeat of this and work toward a more collaborative approach.",

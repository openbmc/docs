      "message": "That\u0027s what I was talking about with Andrew Jeffery - he said, perhaps we should not specify the behavior of the gpio, just the name. I didn\u0027t see any pushback against dropping the description in parentheses from that discussion.\n\nIf I keep the text in parentheses, does anyone have any problems with the wording?\n(indicates that a factory reset should be performed when the switch state is changed)\n\nI could specify more or less in this description - I could note that there are only two states, or that the change is checked upon reboot, but I think those specifications might be unnecessary. I could remove mention of the switch state so it only says, (indicates that a factory reset should be performed)\n\nI\u0027m still leaning towards factory-reset-toggle as the name for the gpio for Milton\u0027s reasons, although I would also be okay with factory-reset-on-toggle.",

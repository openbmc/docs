I didn\u0027t see any pushback against dropping the description in parentheses from that discussion.\n\nOk, I must have misunderstood.  I think that this line loses a lot of value if we don\u0027t indicate a design on how the pin is consumed, since the only value in documenting these names is for consistency of implementations.\n\n\u003e If I keep the text in parentheses, does anyone have any problems with the wording?\n(indicates that a factory reset should be performed when the switch state is changed)\n\nI think we should change this to be a \u0027####\u0027 section so that we are not constrained by the thoughts we can fit in a parenthetical.\n\n    #### air-water\n    [ text that was in the parenthetical ]\n\n    #### factory-reset-toggle\n    [ write a real description of what happens ]\n\nI would tend to avoid using the word \u0027switch\u0027 personally because that implies a particular physical manifestation.  From our perspective here we\u0027re just talking about a GPIO.  There isn\u0027t any reason this GPIO couldn\u0027t be fed from a micro-controller sitting in an operator panel rather than a physical switch.",

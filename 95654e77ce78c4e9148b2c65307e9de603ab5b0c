I don\u0027t really know how this solves the issue of tracking the completion of systemd services that we have started in the updater process.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\n- If there is a service kicking off a custom tool for applying an update, don\u0027t you want that service to exit once the update is done?  So it will never have Progress.Status \u003d Completed or Aborted because it will simply exit.\n\n- If the service doesn\u0027t exit, how do we garbage collect them?\n\n- How do you ensure that two updates are not applied to the same device in close proximity (ie, while one is updating the other one is started)?\n\n- What do we do if the update fails in the middle?  Are any errors reported back to the ItemUpdater?  Or is it expected to monitor for the systemd status on the service it kicked off?",

Aspeed has a reference design that doesn\u0027t drain the battery that fast if you aren\u0027t actively monitoring it.  Our implementation samples the battery ADC at a pretty low rate (about once an hour) and we don\u0027t have trouble with them wearing out that fast.\n\nThere was originally a bug in the Aspeed reference design that was missing some circuitry needed to prevent the ADC from having too much parasitic draining, but that isn\u0027t controlled by a GPIO in their reference design.",

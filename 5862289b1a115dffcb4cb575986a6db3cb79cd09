      "message": "This gpio doesn\u0027t imply if the system has redundancy though.  It tells hw logic how many ps are expected to be present\u0026working for this type of system.  In IBMs case they happen to support redundant ps in all types of these systems, so in either state, we have redundancy.  A subtle difference...and I\u0027m not sure if other companies support oversubscription so would even use this gpio.  I don\u0027t have a strong opinion on what it\u0027s called, just want to make sure the usage is understood correctly before suggesting a name.",

      "message": "This gpio doesn\u0027t imply if the system has redundancy though.  It tells hw logic how many ps are expected to be present\u0026working for this type of system.  In IBMs case they happen to support redundant ps in all types of these systems, so in either state, we have redundancy.  A subtle difference...and I\u0027m not sure if other companies support oversubscription so would even use this gpio.  I don\u0027t have a strong opinion on what it\u0027s called, just want to make sure the usage is understood correctly before suggesting a name.",

      "message": "Thank you Derek.\n\nSince this GPIO is consumed by a hardware specific circuit and not directly part of the the over-subscription concept, but instead gives information to a platform circut I think this is further evidence that this gpio is not expected to be reused beyond derivatives of this system, and any reuse would require configuration rendering it beyond the purpose of this document.",

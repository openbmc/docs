      "message": "Overall, I reviewed this, and while I left a ton of comments, I\u0027m not convinced the design doc process is the right one for something like this.  I suspect that a design doc approval alone won\u0027t be enough to allow or disallow cloudbuild into the project, and its inclusion into openbmc-build-scripts is going to depend heavily on:\n1. How invasive the code changes it needs to make are.\n2. If the maintainers are willing to maintain it (and if not, if he\u0027s willing to let someone else maintain a portion of the build scripts that contain gcb).\n3. If the measured impacts to the obvious performance metrics (build time, SLA ect) are compelling enough to be worth the cost of the switch.\n4. If the \"Open\" part of openbmc can be maintained, while still allowing gcb support.\n\nAs an experiment, and line of engineering, this sounds very interesting, and something that\u0027s worth pursuing.  I don\u0027t think any of the maintainers can answer any of the above questions without seeing a series of patchsets, so my recommendation would be to start working.  Try to determine the refactorings and cleanups that need to happen that are irrelevant to enabling cloudbuild, and get those pushed first in your series, then get a basic prototype working, and we can evaluate the above from there.\n\n\nOverall, I think having more options for heterogeneity in build-server use is a good thing, not bad, and we should encourage it to the point that the complexity and maintainability will allow it.\n\nOne thing that isn\u0027t made clear in this design doc, but should be;  At this point Google has no plans that I\u0027m aware of for removing the non-gcb Jenkins CI resources that we currently donate to the project.  If gcb turns out to be a compelling option for any of the important metrics, there\u0027s an obvious path for us to convert how we donate to the project in the form of gcb resources instead of direct compute, but that will be a much bigger discussion, and has to encompass the best needs for the project.\n\n\nOverall, good stuff, lets see some good results.",

      "message": "Hello Ed, thanks a lot for your detailed review. I would like Simon to answer most of your questions. \n\nI can provide some high level context: this is a 3-month intern project, and what is scoped is providing an alternative CI for \"on demand BMC releases\" only. The main target users for Google are Google\u0027s vendors. It\u0027s unlikely we will replace Jenkins in this time period. Instead, if we can finish the GCB configuration, get an E2E workflow demoed, push PRs to openbmc-build-scripts, and get them reviewed at the end of the internship, that\u0027s a solid start of the upstream GCB story, and it also fulfills our internal use cases. Google team and vendors will maintain the contributed codes.",

This is a super interesting line of research, and we should keep looking into it, but I think discord is probably a better forum for talking about individual changes, given that nobody on this doc is going to be able to approve that level of scope, so I would get on the #infrastruture channel, and start sending PRs for the things you need to do, and you can talk with the CI maintainers there when individual things come up that you\u0027d like to refactor in openbmc-build-scripts.  I suspect the abstraction of the separation is going to be important in those discussions.\n\n\n\u003e push PRs to openbmc-build-scripts, and get them reviewed at the end of the internship,\n\nI\u0027m sure you know this, but it\u0027s worth reiterating, don\u0027t push all your reviews at the end of the internship.  Make incremental progress over time in a series of patchsets submitted as you work, keeping the maintainers in the loop.  That will get you the best result.",

Builds should be able to operate without administrator gerrit credentials, and when running without them, should avoid actions that require credentials (ie, setting build verify flags, ect).\n5. Artifacts from the build system are made available the public through appropriate linking\n6. System must be capable of setting the Verified status on gerrit patches.\n7.

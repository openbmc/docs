      "message": "AFAICS we don\u0027t have a post-complete GPIO mentioned anywhere else in this document at the moment though; should we add it as part of this change?  And given the naming style encouraged by this document, is there a reason we\u0027re referencing names like this in ALLCAPS_CAMEL_CASE instead of lower-kebab-case style?\n\nAlso, grammar-wise there should be an \"is\" before \"typically\". and I think it\u0027d read a little more naturally with an article (\"a\" or \"the\") before the signal name (e.g. \"a POST_COMPLETE line\" or \"the POST_COMPLETE line\") -- or perhaps alternately just drop \"line\".  (And likewise elsewhere where similar sentences appear.)",

      "message": "While it doesn\u0027t seem to be spelled out explicitly here as far as I can see, I assume the idea here is that the one-shot service would exit after performing the GPIO initialization described by the config file?\n\nIf so, that doesn\u0027t sound like a great fit with the \"modern\" (non-legacy) kernel GPIO interface, under which I believe GPIO state is undefined after the process exits (or the relevant file descriptors are closed).  Depending on implementation details of the underlying components (kernel/drivers, hardware), whatever initialization had been performed might just be immediately reverted.\n\n(And alternately, if the process sticks around to maintain the specified GPIO state I think that would prevent anything else from being able to access those GPIOs, which also probably isn\u0027t what we\u0027d want -- if you just want GPIOs tied statically, a device-tree gpio-hog could achieve that.)",

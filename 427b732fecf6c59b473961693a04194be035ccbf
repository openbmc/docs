      "message": "\u003e \u003e What you are asking for is an implementation level detail such as args being passed in (not part of design). \n\u003e \n\u003e I consider it to be part of the design as it will likely be used downstream and in openbmc/openbmc meta layers. That where people keep many of their systemd services for customization. If i understand correctly, what you are proposing is not something that can be easily refactored later on.\n\nFYI: I have changed the service prototype to accept in args if user wants to pass them.\n\nYes, thats where these services will stay, but what these services are specific to individual type of updaters, just as the EM schemas are specific to individual device configs. For instance, a VR case might need 2 args for VRI2CUpdater (lets say i2c bus number, address) and no args might be needed for BIOS Updater, so it needs to an agreement between the service caller and callee. What i am proposing here is a structure for an agreement but what would the exact terms (in args) for that would vary from Updater to Updater, hence we cannot fix them.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e It would be good if this patch already outlined what the interface will look like between the code updater and systemd services. Will there be a common interface or will it be custom arguments for each device specific code updater? \n\u003e Let\u0027s add that to the patch also.\n\nNo, common structure for in_args for reason mentioned above. I have updated patch to reflect this intent.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Also, what value does the service return to the code updater?\n\nAdded details on JobRemoved signal.\n\n\u003e If the PreUpdate service fails, will the code updater proceed with the update?\n\u003e What will be logged? \n\u003e How long does the code updater wait until the service hook is considered failed?\n\nUpdated patch to reflect the behavior.",

      "message": "I\u0027m slightly concerned that we\u0027re signing the SPL directly from the OTP.  I don\u0027t have the AST2600 datasheet handy to be able to know what capabilities are available in hardware.\n\nI recently worked on another project using the Marvell Armada 3700.  The way secure boot works there is that there was an additional indirection from the OTP to SPL.  OTP key -\u003e SW keychain key -\u003e SPL key.  It also had ability to put in up to 4 OTP keys and to later on expire them in the field (invalidate the valid bit).\n\nThere are a few reasons for this:\n\n1. Having a few OTP slots allows you to expire hardware keys.  A single key does not give you any mechanism if your key has been leaked or cracked.\n\n2. There is some concern that the more times you use a key to sign the less secure that key becomes.  Having the indirection gives you a higher order of signings you can do.\n\nDoes the AST2600 give us any mechanism for an indirection like this?",

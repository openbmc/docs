It could be enhanced if needed.\nThe BMCWeb implementation of Basic Auth is in https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/include/token_authorization_middleware.hpp function performBasicAuth().  It could be re-structured so that an account that has an expired password and uses Basic Auth\n - will be limited to the ConfigureSelf privilege.\n - will get the same results (same auth and same messages) as from /login users.\n\nBut that would be more work.

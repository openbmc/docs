      "message": "Insert new paragraph here:\nTo clarify, when BMCWeb returns HTTP status 403 Forbidden -and- the session has the special PasswordChangeRequired condition, the HTTP response body may have additional information to help the user diagnose the problem.\n- For Redfish APIs (under the /redfish URI), the Redfish PasswordChangeRequired extended message is sent.\n- For APIs which return a JSON object (such as the DBus REST APIs), the HTTP response message body will contain a top-level JSON field: \"errorExtendedInfo\" \u003d \"The password for this account must be changed.  PATCH the \u0027Password\u0027 property for the account under URI: /redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/\u003caccountID\u003e\", with the appropriate accountID.\n- For other APIs, no additional information is sent.  Please note this is simply a straw-man design point which was added to help explain the design; such APIs can be enhanced as needed.",

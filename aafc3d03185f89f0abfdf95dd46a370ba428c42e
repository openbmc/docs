Taking this I\u0027m make a conclusion that peci-pcie is inventory of PCIe itself.\n\nI see the confusion.  A PCIe device is not an inventory item.  It\u0027s literally a PCIe device available at the phy layer.  It intentionally does not differentiate between add in cards, boards, ect, which ARE inventory items.  Maybe that clears some things up?\n\n\n\u003e Well, for the and customer prospective, it should somehow filter out built-in devices,\n\nI don\u0027t necessarily agree with that.  Defining what devices are \"built-in\" versus which devices aren\u0027t is subtle.  Is a PCIe device on the CPU complex \"built-in\"?  IMO, PCIeDevice should show all logical pcie devices available to the PCIe complex.  Any filtering would be subtle to define correct behavior of, and I don\u0027t think anyone has proposed how to do that, so for the moment, we publish all devices.\n\n\u003e but otherwise this do exactly what we need: show each plugged device regardless of whether we know about each particular device.\n\nCorrection: Show every logical PCIe device.  the PCIeDevice schema does not require the device to be a separate plug in.  If you want to identify a specific device as a plugin, write an EM config for it, matching off the PCIe vendor ID, and add Type: Board to it to create a PCIe device.\n\n\u003e I tried to bring EM configuration file to add all items found by peci-pcie to EM, but this was weird.\n\nI\u0027m open to suggestions for how this could be made better, but \"weird\" isn\u0027t the best description to key off to how we could make this better.",

The people in the community that care about a given subsystem should be able to read and understand that subsystem from code.  If it\u0027s too complex for that, we should prioritize simplifying the code rather than writing down documentation that will quickly be out of date.  I have no illusions that the codebase is large, but there isn\u0027t that much code for the inventory system, and it\u0027s pretty reasonable to look at code and understand it.\n\nTo that end, I do have patches to continue to simplify it in the mapper.\n\n\u003e Other thing, the existing code in not always represent the \"rules\" on \"how it supposed to be\", it more \"how it happens to be\". E.g. take a look on x86-power-control: it is here,\n\nWe probably disagree on how important documenting interfaces are outside of the code.  The great part about open source is that you can just go look at the code to understand how an interface works, and there\u0027s less need for contracts.\n\n\u003e  but it definitely not how one should write new application (it uses lot of undocumented interfaces, and those interfaces which are documented, used wrong).\n\nThat\u0027s hard to say, given that x86-power-control is used quite heavily and fulfills a need (at this point AMD, Ampere, and intel systems use it) so this is a great example of utility being more important than documentation.\n\nRegardless, we\u0027re going on a tangent.  This doc isn\u0027t about power control, and x86-power-control doesn\u0027t have inventory interfaces.",

Unfortunately, there is a new release cycle coming for us, so I\u0027ll be busy on internal fork again for next month, but it is in my plans to make some PoC. I will keep in mind you points on sensor relation.",

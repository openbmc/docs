Ideally we\u0027d make the barrier to entry lower for that, ideally making the code more consistent, but I dont think anyone has taken that up yet.  If you\u0027re interested, ping me on discord and we can chat about it, or send me some patches.",

      "message": "PLDM is managing a sub-controller, so it SHOULD have its own inventory tree in the current design, because it\u0027s the one with in-depth access to that inventory information for devices on the other end of that bus.  I think the subtlety that\u0027s being missed here is that EM is designed to manage the resources within the BMC.  That doesn\u0027t mean that it needs to be the ONLY thing managing resources for the system.  There are other sub controllers that need accounted for, and can have complex inventory hierarchies.",

That use case should be doable, and have resilience against crashing (ie, if the underlying daemon crashes, the resources should be cleaned up).  If there\u0027s a way to get both behaviors, I\u0027m open to design changes, but thusfar I haven\u0027t seen any code that accomplishes both.",

      "message": "Can you give examples of use cases that don\u0027t work?  peci-pcie doesn\u0027t expose inventory items, so that shouldn\u0027t ever work until there\u0027s a config with a peci-pcie probe statement in it.\n\nSMBIOS-mdr, yeah, that\u0027s an issue that needs a lot of cleaning up.  The complexity there is that smbios-mdr has a lot of interfaces that don\u0027t necessarily need to go in entity-manager (at least, that author didn\u0027t think so).  cleaning that up probably deserves its own design doc.\n\nCPU info is another daemon that somewhat goes outside the initial intent of the design.  Ideally because CPUs are themselves \"entities\", CPUs should have an entity-manager config file that contains the XeonCPU exposes record in it.  In the current set of config files, XeonCPU is attached to the motherboard, which complicates this.  if this is something you\u0027re interested in tackling, I can give you some pointers on how to go about it.",

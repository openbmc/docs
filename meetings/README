OPENBMC MEETINGS
================
This takes the YAML formatted meetings.yaml file and converts to a .ics file
that can be used as input into a calendar. This process allows for adding
additional meetings in the future, just by adding another record to the yaml
file, as well as automating ical generation and email. The tool that is used
to do the conversion is yaml2ical. Follow the usege and installation
instructions here:

https://github.com/openstack-infra/yaml2ical

Start by editing meetings.yaml, changing the fields to the needed values. You
can get more description on the supported fields at the link above.

Once you are happy with the info in the yaml file, run the tool yaml2ical:

yaml2ical -f -y . -o meetings.ics

The -f parameter forces an overwrite of the existing ical file.

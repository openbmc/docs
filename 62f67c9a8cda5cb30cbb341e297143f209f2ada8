How would it know that? \n\nWhat if a card with LEDs off of an IO/LED expander is added at runtime (and there is some code that would bind the 955x or whatever driver)?\n\nIf the service that was triggered from the udev event just sent a dbus message to your new daemon, then it wouldn\u0027t need a concept of \u0027done\u0027?",

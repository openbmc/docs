      "message": "Some of the sentences here feel redundant. Can you please reword it?\n\nAlso to pick at a detail, my understanding is that it\u0027s not the case there\u0027s \"no direct BMC access\", that implies to me there\u0027s no hardware connection. Perhaps something like:\n\n\u003e The proprietary, HPE-controlled bootblock firmware communicates with a secure element to retrieve portions of the platform vital product data (VPD). It uses a driver whose implementation is strictly license-controlled and cannot be publicly released. The open source portions of the boot chain must adapt to the bootblock\u0027s reserved memory ABI for providing the VPD from the secure element.\n\nAlso I think it\u0027s worth discussing the extent of the other data provided through this interface. I dug up what I think is the relevant code-path in your u-boot fork:\n\nhttps://github.com/HewlettPackard/gxp-uboot/blob/384fc0fef13dae9c1567c1f1a6cdac491e7e2b90/board/hpe/gxp/gxp_board.c#L211-L216\n\nSo it looks like the GXP and PCA (what\u0027s the PCA?) part number and serial number, NIC MAC addresses? Are there other properties too or is this the set?\n\nBecause, you can exploit the `mac-address` property from the `ethernet-controller` devicetree schema to deal with the MAC metadata:\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/ethernet-controller.yaml?h\u003dv6.7-rc5#n20\n\nAm I looking in the right place here?",

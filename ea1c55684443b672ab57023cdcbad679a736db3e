      "message": "This description talks about a count, but later talks about the number \"expected of the two models\".   My understanding is 2 vs 4 required.  A single bit can be one of 2 states, so cout 0-1 might be a bit low.  \n\nAlso might need to clarify this is an output from the code?\n\nMaybe \"power-config-full-load\", \"power-supplies-max\"  or similar, as its telling a hardware circuit that gives a warning to other hardware what the threshold should , and the state says if its all or a subset of supplies (as I presently understand).",

I feel that adding in another option to these docs just makes it confusing for a new developer. I\u0027d prefer we stick with Romulus as the only thing discussed in here as we know it is supported because our CI infrastructure utilizes it. I\u0027d lean more toward what you have in here going out in https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-evb/meta-evb-aspeed/meta-evb-ast2600/README.md",

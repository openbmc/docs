description: The support page provides information about getting help with using the design system
---

Talk about the importance of communication between [makers and users](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#design-system-makers-and-users) of the design system.

## Support channels
Where can people go for help with the design system? Where do people talk about the design system? Where should bugs be filed? Cross-link to the <a href="{{ "/contribute.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">contributing page</a> as there's often overlap between this kind of information.

## Support opportunities
Training and support can [take many forms](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#training-and-support), including:

- Pair sessions
- Workshops
- Webinars
- Consulting sessions
- Tutorials
- Employee onboarding
- Office hours
- Chat tools
- Issue trackers
- Forums

Take the time to present all support and training information; it helps give users confidence you have their backs when they get stuck.

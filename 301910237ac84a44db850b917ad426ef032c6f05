Both describe files that are read at runtime to configure an application.\n\nThe phosphor-regulators JSON config file is read at runtime to configure application behavior.

      "message": "The phosphor-regulators application looks in two places for its JSON config file:\n\n* /etc/phosphor-regulators: Writable file system directory where new versions of the config file can be manually installed and tested.  Used by system integrators/system engineers/developers.  Not required to exist.\n* /usr/share/phosphor-regulators: Read-only file system directory where the standard version of the config file exists.  Installed there as part of the firmware image.  Required to exist.\n\nCan this approach (looking in both /etc and /usr/share) be included as an option within this document?  I feel it has several advantages:\n* Makes testing new config files easier.  Can just scp to /etc.  Doesn\u0027t require system integrators/system engineers to work with file system overlays to test config file changes in /usr/share.\n* Simple to revert to the standard config file.  Just remove the /etc directory/file.\n* Makes it clearer when a test config file is in use.  You can tell by checking if the /etc/ directory/file exists, and the application can put an entry in the journal giving the path to the config file that was used.  This is very helpful for debugging.",

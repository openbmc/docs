I don\u0027t see how this review can get merged by upstream maintainers in the timeframe you\u0027re looking for.  There\u0027s too many technical questions unanswered to say whether or not this kind of design would be accepted, and those questions would largely only be answered by patchsets showing utility and abstractions in backing resources, not design docs.\n\nI also just realized that the CI maintainer (Geissler) wasn\u0027t even CCed on this review;  Considering that he\u0027s the one that would likely be approving any code-level changes to ci or openbmc-build-scripts, it seems important that he is included in the design.",

      "message": "Thanks Ed, the intention is not merge this review during my internship. Rather, I\u0027d like to push for some additional discussions as much as possible. I only have around 1.5 months left in my internship, so yes that timeframe is unrealistic, but I hope I can progress this review a lot further ðŸ˜Š",

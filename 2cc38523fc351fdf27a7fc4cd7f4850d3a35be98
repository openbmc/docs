FWIW, our private things our our problem (we can talk more offline about how to design them) but splitting up control for a single piece of hardware among various daemons is a huge pain, and is the source of many reliability, performance, and interfacing bugs.  One daemon should be responsible for one piece of hardware.  If you want to share code between them for common stuff, put it in a library that both daemons can use, but being able to control a modules IO access all in one place helps a ton for use cases like firmware update, where the hardware itself is broken, and does crazy stuff like requires all firmware update payloads to be contiguous.\n\nFWIW, an upstream design doc shouldn\u0027t really mention \"private\" use cases, hence the word \"private\" ðŸ˜Š",

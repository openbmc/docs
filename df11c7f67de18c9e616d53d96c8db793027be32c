      "message": "As Ed indicated, it\u0027s not an easy and smooth way to convert to meson from cmake, gaps exist.\ncmake is modern and it support C++20 as well.\nThe \"Rationale\" about cmake is it lacks of tools to build outside of oe-sdk env. But one could either build and test it with openbmc-build-scripts, or some existing repos already has external_project defined to build in typical Linux system.",

      "message": "My goal was to add a document to help users how to launch and access KVM, since there’s currently no document for that. But based on the feedback, it looks like the scope is growing beyond just launching KVM.\nFor now, I think it’s okay to include just the basic steps to launch KVM. If we want to add more details (like how to enable KVM or handle system-level integration) it might need more time and discussion. Let me know your thoughts.",

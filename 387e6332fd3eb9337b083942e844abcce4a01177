      "message": "I wonder if we need a requirement to support devices that have primary/backup designs. For example, some systems have 2 flash chips for BMC firmware. Some have a single emmc that it is carved up into 2 copies. Is that all abstracted by the service implementing the update?",

      "message": "We\u0027ve had memory issues before (our images can be 100MB+ in size). Multiple of these sticking around in memory for parallel updates could be dangerous. Is there any chance of being able to still offload to /tmp and then send the fd to that file to the update services vs. keeping it all in bmcweb memory? Does allowing bmcweb access to /tmp really raise security concerns?",

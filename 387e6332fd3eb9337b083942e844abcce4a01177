      "message": "I wonder if we need a requirement to support devices that have primary/backup designs. For example, some systems have 2 flash chips for BMC firmware. Some have a single emmc that it is carved up into 2 copies. Is that all abstracted by the service implementing the update?",

      "message": "We\u0027ve had memory issues before (our images can be 100MB+ in size). Multiple of these sticking around in memory for parallel updates could be dangerous. Is there any chance of being able to still offload to /tmp and then send the fd to that file to the update services vs. keeping it all in bmcweb memory? Does allowing bmcweb access to /tmp really raise security concerns?",

Isn\u0027t this just a monorepo by another name?\n\nI don\u0027t expect there to really be a lot of sharing between the update portions of this.  It also gives a clear path for supporting non-opensource updates (which, while not a primary focus of this project, is an unfortunate reality).\n\nI don\u0027t really think there is a lot of [code] overlap in update for the BMC, voltage regulators (i2c), NICs (pldm), and CPLDs (JTAG).  Do we really want all these different interfaces, and corresponding access libraries, needing to be linked into a single repository?  What happens if/when various CPLD vendors give us separate libraries for their special flavor of JTAG?\n\nMy opinion is that if the interface requires a lot of boiler-code that is copied around various repositories, we\u0027ve failed in defining the interface.  Let\u0027s fix that (if it is a problem) rather than trying to cram everything into one big repo.",

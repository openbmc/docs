      "message": "Sure, it could.  Is it interesting to do that?  The Google team had a direct need for cable detection, which has an obvious mechanism for packing, and they were writing the code.  I don\u0027t think it is obvious how to extrapolate the code into a generic presence detect over IPMI nor is it obvious in my mind that this is useful generically to be consumed by users.  If someone has a proposal they could certainly refactor what has been delivered, right?",

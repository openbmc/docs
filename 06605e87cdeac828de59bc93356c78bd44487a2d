      "message": "Having read the document, I understand the socket interface for mctp messages, and I realise that the most common use of the socket API is talking to network devices. I am missing the bit that links mctp to network devices.\n\nMy confusion comes about because I thought we were generally talking about sending mctp over devices other than network (Ethernet) devices? Does this mean we will have network drivers that instead of Ethernet are backed by eg a LPC device?",

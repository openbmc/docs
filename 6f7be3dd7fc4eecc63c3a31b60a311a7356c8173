      "message": "FYI: This design doc about [System Diagnostic Data Collection](https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/docs/+/79448) can give a view about how PLDM File Transfer can be used in a system context. In this design, `phosphor-debug-collector` is the one directly interacting with the file interfaces and providing D-Bus interfaces for bmcweb to trigger collecting/offloading dump records. Hence, the blocking issue caused by libfuse might not impact bmcweb.",

      "message": "How about a libpldm API for discovery (file paths and related metadata)? File reads/writes can be just as regular files (with inotify based mechanism if pldmd has to update files to the device, or writes could be a libpldm API).",

Can we just make it a “hello world”.\n\u003e \n\u003e * We already have examples on how to make a dbus application in the sdbus repository.\n\nIf I moved the existing code here, would that help?  (thinking out loud for a second).\n\nI really want this to be a \"here\u0027s all the boilerplate you need to create a well behaving openbmc app\".  Part of being well behaved involves connecting to dbus, and writing unit tests for dbus methods, so I want to provide good examples of doing that, even if we have multiple ways to do it.\n\nThe existing examples are pretty complex, and are really good reference for \"here\u0027s every way you could want to do this\".  IMO, this wants something different, \"here\u0027s the boilerplate you need to do the basics\".\n\n\u003e * I don’t particularly want to encourage manually creating dbus interfaces, as shown here.  (I know we have some differences of opinion on asio, etc. and I’m working on resolving some of that with co-routines support).\n\nDon\u0027t we already support asio coroutines?  I swear that support was already in the asio bindings, and you could register methods that accept a yield_context if you wanted the coroutine version.  I\u0027m not against it if you want to move to c++20 style coroutines, but we probably need to have a path forward for those already using them, although that\u0027s a discussion for a different patchset.\n\n\n\nBack to the issue at hand, I\u0027m not sure how to reconcile what you\u0027ve asked with the goals here.  The goal is to provide the current \"state of the art\", and doesn\u0027t need to cross reference 8 different examples to do what it needs for a basic, no frills dbus interface, with unit tests.\n\nWhat if this contained two examples?  An asio one, and a phosphor-dbus-interfaces one, that way, at least we could have something, then as we converge on a single solution, the two examples simply turn into one that meets both needs.  In the meantime, we\u0027d at least be pointing out that there are multiple ways to do these things, and that there are pros and cons to each.\n\nWould a path like that alleviate your concerns?",

I thought this was going to be a “how do I set up my repository”.

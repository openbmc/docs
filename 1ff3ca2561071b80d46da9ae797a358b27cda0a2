If someone isn\u0027t willing to be relatively consistently responsive, they shouldn\u0027t give the impression that they are a \"maintainer\".  List yourself as a reviewer so you get informed and can provide feedback when you\u0027re able, but don\u0027t put yourself up as a block for others to get code merged.",

      "message": "+1 to Patricks reply.  While there is certainly value in sporadic engagement, having folks with authority, but no required responsibility can lead to deadlock as we\u0027ve seen in the past, and is the point of this document.  Of course, there are likely arrangements among maintainers that can keep forward progress with overlapping responsibilities if maintainers need to \"go dark\" for a time, and can hand off responsibilities to others in an orderly fashion, and by my read, this policy doesn\u0027t preclude that arrangement, even if it doesn\u0027t explicitly call it out.  This doc only applies if someone has made a report that things are not happening an an orderly fashion.",

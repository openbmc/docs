I would expect a health discussion around viability of path hierarchies.\n\nEd claims there are degenerate cases, that will not work in a hierarchical modeling such as \"backplanes\". The claim is back plans are (1)both contained by the chassis and (2)plugged into the motherboard. Making the hierarchical modeling difficult. \n\nThere are more examples of challenges created by hierarchical modeling, and it might save time to address them in this section.",

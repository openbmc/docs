      "message": "Patrick: my understanding is there is a switch that can be flipped from one position to another. The decision we reached in the design exchange today was that for now, the switch state will only be checked by the initrd script during BMC boot, in order to avoid adding complexity. We could add a daemon later.\n\nAndrew G: ok, I assume I just do this with a newline. I\u0027ll add it if we don\u0027t decide to scrap specifying the behavior of the gpio.\n\nAndrew J: That seems fine to me, especially since the exact behavior of how factory-reset-toggle will be used is not set in stone because it\u0027s not implemented yet.",

My understanding from Chris Engel is that the BMC knows the last state of the switch, and during power-on if it sees that the state has changed, it will do a factory reset.  It is not an on/off kind of thing.\n\nMilton Miller: Also toggle should be in the generic gpio name @andrewg fyi",

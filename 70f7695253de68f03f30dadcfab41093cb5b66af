      "message": "How about\n\n\"If maintainers enable checks beyond these, they shall ensure that within 5 business days of a new clang release, all tidy errors in the new checks have been resolved.\"\n\nHonestly, the tidy updates themselves have been getting easier in the last few years, clang compiler warnings have been the issue.   I would much rather that we have some experience with the checks before we try to enable them project wide.  There\u0027s a lot of checks in the next patch that we know cause problems that we don\u0027t have solutions to;  I\u0027d rather there be a path for checks to be enabled selectively on a per repo basis ahead of doing it in docs.",

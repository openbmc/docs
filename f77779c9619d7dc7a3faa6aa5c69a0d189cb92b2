      "message": "As an EM/dbus-sensors maintainer, I\u0027m not interested in supporting two different ways of representing DBus.  Supporting the one we have is difficult enough and what\u0027s proposed here isn\u0027t any simpler.  Unfortunately what we have today does allow PDI-based reactors to function, so I\u0027m going to spend time, it likely won\u0027t be on this.\n\nIf there are other reactor maintainers that want to band together and work through all the use cases to make this work, I\u0027m in full support of staging that effort under an option key once we get enough critical mass.\n\nI do worry that we\u0027ve left out a ton of requirements, and every one of these requirements is based on DBus.  We need to refocus them on the developer and the user part of the requirements.  I would far prefer very messy internal DBus structures, and functional user/developer APIs to the alternative.  If we can have both, I\u0027m in full support, and will likely help, but I don\u0027t think this as written gets us there, and the requirements need to be updated to reflect the users of this software, not the developers of this software.",

      "message": "This is always a bit of a edge case. Technically this should just be described in the EM board configuration for either the BMC or backplane or wherever the LEDs are and there\u0027s no need to describe it in the devicetree. However, if it is static configuration (which it sounds like it is if you\u0027re proposing to put it in the devicetree) then the devicetree is not an unreasonable spot for it. We just need to make sure that neither EM nor phosphor-led-sysfs detect when the LEDs already exist in sysfs and don\u0027t take any further action.",

Technically this should just be described in the EM board configuration for either the BMC or backplane or wherever the LEDs are and there\u0027s no need to describe it in the devicetree. However, if it is static configuration (which it sounds like it is if you\u0027re proposing to put it in the devicetree) then the devicetree is not an unreasonable spot for it. We just need to make sure that neither EM nor phosphor-led-sysfs detect when the LEDs already exist in sysfs and don\u0027t take any further action.",

      "message": "The names which are defined in the device tree for GPIO LEDs will be given in the entity-manager configuration. Once the interface (xyz.openbmc_project.Configuration.Led) for LED is added in entity-manager dbus path, the dbus signal will triggered in phosphor-led-sysfs daemon and the properties mentioned in that interface will be read. Those properties result will represents the LED name and it will be compared with the /sys/class/leds/ path to check the LED is created or not. IF the LED name does not match with /sys/ path created, then dbus path will not be created.\n\nExample:\nDeviceTree:\n        leds {\n                compatible \u003d \"gpio-leds\";\n                ledName {\n                        label \u003d \"group:blue:powerled\";\n                        gpios \u003d \u003c\u0026gpio ASPEED_GPIO(M, 0) GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH\u003e;\n                };\n        };\n        \nEntity Manager conf:\n\n        {\n            \"Class\": \"group\",\n            \"Name\": \"powerled\",\n            \"Name1\": \"blue\",\n            \"Type\": \"Led\"\n        }\n\nsys path :  /sys/class/leds/group:blue:powerled\n\nThis is the approach implemented in phosphor-led-sysfs repository.

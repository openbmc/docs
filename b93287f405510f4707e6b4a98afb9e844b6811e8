My concern is, for example the API is identified as \"createOEMPrivilege\", which implies Redfish.  We should be able to create and modify groups via User.Manager, which it doesn\u0027t support today, but we shouldn\u0027t explicitly create/modify \"Redfish Groups\".  The fact that some prefix is used for Redfish should be kept to Redfish-aware code, which doesn\u0027t belong in User.Manager.",

I mentioned above it might be handy to be able to use LDAP for these same roles.  We\u0027ll want something halfway globally unique in order to be able to leverage LDAP.  (What I mean by this is that a company can add the group \u0027openbmc-rf-adminstrator\u0027 to a user in their AD and they gain Redfish:Administrator access on their fleet).\n\nUnfortunately this prefix also consumes some of the 31 characters.  Maybe 20 characters is still enough for most purposes (openbmc-rf- \u003d\u003e 11, 31-11\u003d20).",

# User Management - OpenBMC - Design document

## Scope
This document covers the architectural, interface, and design details needed for
user-management components. The implementation detail is beyond the scope of
this document.

## Basic principles in design
1. Use common user-management (e.g. phosphor-user-manager) rather than
application-based user-management. Especially, avoid IPMI based user-management.
2. For security reasons, avoid transmitting passwords over any D-Bus API.
Observe this rule even while creating, modifying or authenticating the user.
3. Have applications use the PAM module to authenticate the user instead of
relying on a D-Bus API-based approach.
4. User creation has to be generic in nature wherever possible.
5. As IPMI requires clear text password (Refer IPMI 2.0 specification, section
13.19-13.33 inclusive for more details), new PAM module (e.g. pam-ipmi modules)
has to be used along with regular PAM password hashing modules (e.g. pam-unix),
which will store the password in encrypted form. Implementation can elect to
skip this if the IPMI daemon is not the part of the distribution or if the user
created doesn't have an 'ipmi' group role.
6. User name, Password, Group and Privilege roles are maintained by the common
user-management (e.g. phosphor-user-manager), whereas individual user-related
settings for any application has to be managed by that application. In other
words, with the exception of User Name, Password, Group and Privileged Role,
the rest of the settings needed has to be owned by the application in question.
(e.g. IPMI daemon has to manage settings like channel based restriction etc.
for the corresponding user). Design is made to cover this scenario.

## Supported Group Roles
The purpose of group roles is to determine the first-level authorization of the
corresponding user. This is used to determine at a high level whether the user
is authorized to the required interface.
In other words, users should not be allowed to login to SSH if they only belong
to webserver group and not to group SSH. Also having group roles in common
user-management (e.g. phosphor-user-manager) allows different application to
create roles for the other (e.g. Administrative user will be able to create a
new user through webserver who will be able to login to webserver/REDFISH &
IPMI etc.)

*Note: Group names are for representation only and can be modified/extended
 based on the need*

|Sl. No| Group Name | Purpose / Comments                |
|-----:|------------|-----------------------------------|
|1     | ssh        | Users in this group are only allowed to login through SSH.|
|2     | ipmi       | Users in this group are only allowed to use IPMI Interface.|
|3     | redfish    | Users in this group are only allowed to use REDFISH Interface.|
|4     | web        | Users in this group are only allowed to use webserver Interface.|

## Supported Privilege Roles
OpenBMC supports privilege roles which are common across all the supported
groups (i.e. User will have same privilege for REDFISH / Webserver / IPMI /
SSH).  User can belong to any one of the following privilege roles at any point
of time.

*Note: Privileges are for representation only and can be modified/extended
 based on the need*

|Sl. No| Privilege roles | Purpose / Comments                |
|-----:|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
|1     | admin           | Users are allowed to configure all OpenBMC (including user-management, network and all configurations). Users will have full administrative access.|
|2     | operator        | Users are allowed to view and control basic operations. This includes reboot of the host, etc. But users are not allowed to change other configuration like user, network, etc.|
|3     | user            | Users only have read access and can't change any behavior of the system.|
|4     | callback        | Lowest privilege level, only allowed to initiate IPMI 2.0 specific callbacks.|

## Common User Manager - D-Bus API (phosphor-user-manager)
User Manager service exposes D-Bus methods for user-management operations.
It exposes `xyz.openbmc_project.User.Manager` as a service and handles
objects through `org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager`. Please refer
https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/tree/master/xyz/openbmc_project/User
for detailed user management D-Bus API and interfaces.

## Authentication flow
Applications must use `pam_authenticate()` API to authenticate user.
Stacked PAM modules are used such that `pam_authenticate()` can be used
for both local & remote users.

```
                +----------------------------------+
                |    Stacked PAM Authentication    |

## Password update
Applications must use `pam_chauthtok()` API to set / change user password.
Stacked PAM modules allow all 'ipmi' group user passwords to be stored
in encrypted form, which will be used by IPMI. The same has been performed
by `pam_ipmicheck` and `pam_ipmisave` modules loaded as first & last modules
in stacked pam modules.

## Recommended Implementation
1. As per IPMI spec the max user list can be 15 (+1 for NULL User). Hence
implementation has to be done in such a way that no more than 15 users are
getting added to the 'ipmi' Group. Phosphor-user-manager has to enforce this
limitation.
2. Should add IPMI_NULL_USER by default and keep the user in disabled state.
This is to prevent IPMI_NULL_USER from being created as an actual user. This is
needed as NULL user with NULL password in IPMI can't be added as an entry from
Unix user-management point of it.
3. User creation request from IPMI / REDFISH must be handled in
the same manner as described in the above flow diagram.
4. Adding / removing a user name from 'ipmi' Group role must force a Password
change to the user. This is needed as adding to the 'ipmi' Group of existing
user requires clear text password to be stored in encrypted form. Similarly
when removing a user from IPMI group, must force the password to be changed
as part of security measure.
5. IPMI spec doesn't support groups for the user-management. Hence the
same can be implemented through OEM Commands, thereby creating a user in
IPMI with different group roles.
6. Do no use 'Set User Name' IPMI command to extend already existing
non-ipmi group users to 'ipmi' group. 'Set User Name' IPMI command will not be
able to differentiate between new user request or request to extend an existing
user to 'ipmi' group. Use OEM Commands to extend existing users to 'ipmi' group.
Note: 'Set User Name' IPMI command will return CCh 'Invalid data field in
Request' completion code, if tried to add existing user in the system.

## Deployment - Out of factory
### Guidelines
As per [SB-327 Information Privacy](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327), Connected devices must avoid
shipping with generic user name & password. The reasonable security expected is
1. Preprogrammed password unique to each device
2. Forcing user to generate new authentication account, before using the device.

### Generating user during deployment:
To adhere above mentioned guideline and to make OpenBMC more secure, this design
specifies about forcing end-user to generate a new account, during deployment
through any of the system in-band interfaces (like KCS etc.).
IPMI 2.0 specification provides commands like `SetUserName`, `SetUserPassword`,
`SetUserAccess`, which must be used to create a new user account instead of
using any generic default user name and password. Accounts created through this
method have access to IPMI, REDFISH & Webserver and can be used to create more
accounts through out-of-band interfaces.

### Special user - root – user id 0:
Exposing root account (user id 0) to end-user by default (other than debug /
developer scenario) is security risk. Hence current architecture recommends not
to enable root user by default for end-user.
For general login for debug / developer builds, a new default user with password
can be created by specifying the same in local.conf.sample file. This can be
used to establish a session by default (CI systems etc. can use this account).
From OpenBMC package user name `openbmc` with password `0penBmc$` can be added.

#### Debugging use-case
`root` user / sudo privilege access are required during development / debug
phase of the program. For this purpose a new IPMI OEM command (TBD) / REDFISH
OEM action(TBD) to can be used to set password for the root user, after which
`root` user can be used to login to the serial console and for further debugging
(Note: `root` user will not be listed as user account in any interfaces like
IPMI / REDFISH from user management point of view).

### Deployment for systems without in-band interfaces:
Any systems which doesn’t have in-band system interface can generate passwords
uniquely for each & every device or can expose a default user name & password
forcing end-user to update the same, before using the device (TBD).

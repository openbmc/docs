The problem is anytime we want to activate a software update which could be applicable for multiple devices.\n\nI don\u0027t think creating a new interface called \u0027biosUpdate\u0027 is the right approach because it doesn\u0027t solve the general problem.  BIOS is really specific to x86 architectures anyhow.",

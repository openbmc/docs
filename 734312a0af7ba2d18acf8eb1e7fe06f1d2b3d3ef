      "message": "Who is the consumer of these D-Bus obbjects? With PDRs, PLDM can directly create Inventory.Item objects. There is also https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/designs/pldm-stack.md#processing-pldm-fru-information-sent-down-by-the-host-firmware.\n\nCan this design focus on PLDM sensors? It could certainly talk about PLDM FRU related PDRs, but I am not sure about exposing inventory. That seems like it should be covered by the link I pasted above or should be updated there.",

EM is for per-device configuration.  If you can \"know\" at an image layer that a software resource exists, ideally we shouldn\u0027t try to detect it in EM.\n\n\u003e - gpio initialization(your proposal?)\n\nGPIO isn\u0027t unique here.  There\u0027s a lot more init that happens in platform init than just GPIO, and a lot of it requires a sequence or map of resources that can\u0027t be represented in an EM config.  For example\n\nStandby power needs asserted\nWait for power good\nInitialize sgpio\nwait for sgpio good\nInitialize GPIO expander\nRead/write GPIO to init hardware.\n\n\u003e - dynamic detection (FruDevice, gpio presence, ...) \n\u003e - dynamic mux initialization\n\u003e - dynamic gpio initialization\n\u003e - possibly again dynamic detection\n\u003e - possibly again dynamic initialization\n\u003e - configuration\n\u003e - sensor daemons\n\nYes, the rest is then handled by EM.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e and EM may need to call into these custom initialization routines \n\u003e in case of dynamic initialization.

Which is the initialization step.\n\nSo having your code be in the EM repo would make it easier to call those handlers.\n\n\nI believe your use-case is similar to the i2c mux feature which is also concerned\nwith initialization\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/entity-manager/+/75484\n\nThe major difference being the stage at which the initialization happens (before / after FruDevice) and how it is configured static/dynamic.\n\nI see no reason why it cannot be supported to have a custom init routine for some hardware component after dynamic detection has started.\n\n\n\u003e Standby power needs asserted\nWait for power good\nInitialize sgpio\nwait for sgpio good\nInitialize GPIO expander\nRead/write GPIO to init hardware.\n\nMany of your mentioned use-cases also apply after i2c muxes have been configured and dynamic detection has happened.\n\nSo these init handlers will also need to be available at that point and cannot just be something to run once then forget about it.\n\n\u003e \"Entity manager shall not directly participate in management of any specific device\"\n\nMaybe it wont\u0027 be so bad if we have a simple handler architecture.\nWith ability to register fixed init functions based on the board\nand then register init / de-init handlers based on `Type` of configuration and also based on individual boards (once detected, not-fixed init)\n\nThis may be useful in your case aswell. So you can do custom init based on\nfields detected by `FruDevice` and handle some board variants/revisions differently.\n\nLike this:\n\n- fixed init hardcoded based on fw image\n- FruDevice starts\n- custom init based on fields from FRU Devices (handle board variants)\n- EM exposes board inventory\n- run custom handlers based on \u0027Type\u0027 of configuration\n- (e.g. init i2c muxes, gpio expanders, ...)\n- expose configuration record\n...\n\nFor example in the ipmi stack they have a way to register custom handler functions and it does not make the core code any more complicated.\n\nSince these handlers are all treated all the same with same function signature and so on.",

If things can be modeled as a \"device\" that\u0027s detectable, I agree, that\u0027s where the line should end for this and entity-manager/reactors should begin. In the examples in the repo today, compile-time selection is not just a fixed case of detection.\n\nThere is a difference in compiled kernel modules, target SoC, devicetree, application support and such.\n\nBut that does not need to limit us in the overall architecture?\n\n\u003e There are no distinction for \"devices\" here. There is a known image that does known steps to init the platform its loaded on, no runtime detection.\n\nWe can simply assume that the image is running on the right hardware (otherwise it would make no sense to run hardware specific init functions) and therefore we have \u0027detected\u0027 it.\n\nI think we are running in circles here. My point is to generalize the design and not think in rigid categories like \u0027platform init\u0027. **The platform is just a device which cannot be removed, of which there is always only one, and which does not need to be detected at runtime.**\n\nThese specifics then allow to run the init handlers for the `platform device` before anything else (including `FruDevice`).\n\n```\nif (GB200){\ndo_gb200_specific_things();\ndo_common_thing_on_bus(2)\n} else if (TyanS7106){\ndo_tyan_specific_things();\ndo_common_thing_on_bus(3);\n}\n```\n\nI like this code sample. Here\u0027s another:\n\n```\nvoid gb200_init(){\n    do_gb200_specific_things();\n    do_common_thing_on_bus(2)\n}\n\ninit_routines \u003d {\n  {\"GB200\", gb200_init},\n  {\"TyanS7016, tyan_s7016_init},\n};\n\ninit_routines[fixed_device]();\n```\n\nWith this structure, init routines can be re-used for devices detected at runtime.\n\n```\nvoid onDeviceAdded(std::string\u0026 dynamic_device){\n\n    if (init_routines.contains(dynamic_device)){\n        init_routines[dynamic_device]();\n    }\n\n    logDeviceAdded(device);\n}\n```\n\nThis could work well with the dynamic i2c mux initialization\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/entity-manager/+/75484",

This code is currently in a meta layer, which is even worse than a common repo with one maintainer.  I\u0027m actually hoping that by pulling in use cases into a common repo instead of putting it in meta layer scripts that they get more scrutiny and review, not less.\n\nThe structure I\u0027d really like to see in this repo is that each platform is in a folder, and each platform maintainer is in the OWNERS for that folder.  Common layers will be reviewed by all platform maintainers that pull in the common components.\n\nOverall, this is something that I think the project needs, and I\u0027m open to having other maintainers.

      "message": "\u003e \u003e The only reason I\u0027m requesting a new repo is that there wasn\u0027t a logical place to put general hardware init code.\n\u003e \n\u003e Does the place to put it really need to be the \u0027logical\u0027 place if there is other convincing advantages?\n\u003e \n\u003e Consider this:\n\u003e \n\u003e - strategy A: Make a new repo from the get-go, then perhaps later struggle to integrate it with EM. Create all structure from scratch and maintain by yourself.\n\u003e \n\u003e - strategy B: Put it in EM repo, get reviewers and existing structure for free.\n\u003e  You can always later rip it out and put into another repo. Properly structured meson projects are quite portable in this way.\n\nI don\u0027t believe those are mutually exclusive, and FWIW, there was some consensus before I pushed this that we didn\u0027t want this to go into a reactor, and I was asked by TOF to request a repo.  I absolutely want other people to help maintain this, I don\u0027t think moving the repo itself gets reviewers for free.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e What\u0027s the advantage in creating another repo?\n\nWe have a place where we can start moving the multitude of bash scripts, init routines, and other things that exist in meta layers and could be more common.  Entity-managers folder structure isn\u0027t set up for per-image ownership or code.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e You can even create a separate bitbake recipe if the code is in an existing repo.\n\u003e Just set the right meson options.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you want to keep an existing bitbake recipe, you can deploy or pull things into the image separately due to split pkg.\n\nAgreed, the recipe part is not the concern.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Because of the regex matching with gerrit you can have separate reviewers / owners even for code in the same repo.\n\nAgreed, in this doc as it stands I intend to use that.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e And you only have to declare the wrap files and dependencies once.\n\u003e \n\u003e What do you really get from yet another repo? Another git remote and and a separate url on github? Consider if you really need it.\n\nopt-in for platforms.  I agree the repo itself isn\u0027t the most important part, but having multiple applications in a single repository has been a source of confusion in the past, and I don\u0027t know of a case where we\u0027ve split the recipe.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e What you are proposing is not a library or something that will *certainly* be re-used by other projects, or is it?\n\nit is _not_ a library, and while it would be reused, it is not intended to be reused in other applications.  It will pull in relevant libraries for IO it needs to do (libgpio etc).",

Entity-manager cannot take per-plaftorm dependencies BECAUSE it is a common core component that we would expect all systems to be able to take.  Yes, PKGCONFIG can alleviate some of these problems, but doesn\u0027t solve the ability for backends to be swapped out at will (or removed entirely) that was part of why EM and dbus-sensors/other reactors are different repositories.

      "message": "Is this referring to the multi-host architecture of Greatlake?\n\nWe get final architecture shared by Patrick and Garnermic for multi-host are as follow: \n1. /xyz/openbmc_project/state/Host{1 to N} corresponds to soft host 1 to N. It includes the poweron/off/softoff/cycle/shutdown ..etc.\n2. /xyz/openbmc_project/state/Chassis{1 to N} corresponds to slot 1 to N. It includes power on/off/cycle.\n3. /xyz/openbmc_project/state/Chassis0 corresponds to entire machine. It includes power(sled) cycle.\n\nAs architected above,Maybe we don\u0027t need subsystems path to represent slots,and add sled-cycle to all chassis object paths.\n\n",

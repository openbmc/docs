It includes the poweron/off/softoff/cycle/shutdown ..etc.\n2. /xyz/openbmc_project/state/Chassis{1 to N} corresponds to slot 1 to N. It includes power on/off/cycle.\n3. /xyz/openbmc_project/state/Chassis0 corresponds to entire machine. It includes power(sled) cycle.\n\nAs architected above,Maybe we don\u0027t need subsystems path to represent slots,and add sled-cycle to all chassis object paths.\n\n",

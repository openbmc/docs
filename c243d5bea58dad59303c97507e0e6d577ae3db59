It has nothing to do with multiple host support.\n\nI don\u0027t think IPMI was ever designed to handle this sort of host aggregation. There is also LUN in every command, but that only goes to 4, which could limit high-density multi-host situations.\n\nRequiring the hosts to do something special (pass an ID or LUN or whatever) for every command seems like it could break things. If the ID is already implicitly encoded in the link the command was received on, why not use that?",

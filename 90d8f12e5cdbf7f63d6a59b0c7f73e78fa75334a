      "message": "This seems like you\u0027re putting constraints on the network topology (one host?) and configuration (static only)? Can you unpack that? Should this work with one BMC host interface with multiple hosts managed via the BMC? Even if the justification is \"in-band IPMI constrains us to one host\" that would help. But even under that circumstance, how do you ensure the host\u0027s interface is configured to meet the assumptions of the BMC\u0027s EM configuration for it? DHCP would be one method of avoiding broken assumptions, but it seems it\u0027s not accommodated by the proposal?",

Having requirement on the Host UEFI and OS support DHCP server is not realistic so just pre-configured static IP address in the BMC side and have some method for the Host to check for BMC IP to work with (to build SMBIOS Type 42 data and application will use information from this data).",

      "message": "I\u0027ll defer to almost anyone else on the UEFI side, as I don\u0027t have much (any) experience there. However, I was approaching this with the view that the BMC would run the internal network and the host would acquire the lease. I wasn\u0027t suggesting that the UEFI implementation also provide a DHCP server, that is definitely too much. But it seems you\u0027re thinking of the ownership the other way around to what I am? Is there a reason for it to be one way or the other? It would be good to unpack the answer to that in the document.",

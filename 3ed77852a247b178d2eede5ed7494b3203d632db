I have sent out a note for you here:  https://lore.kernel.org/openbmc/e674332a-6956-4184-b077-39a0cc0e624d@gmail.com/T/#u\n\nIt\u0027s quite a while since the original design document was merged - but till now there is no code-drop. Do you still have plans to work on the spdm code ? Can you please take a look at my email and reply back ?",

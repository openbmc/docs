      "message": "This seems like an odd fit here. What did you have in mind?\n\nSmBus is a subset of i2c. I didn’t think it really had any protocol specification related to host communications. Wouldn’t it be something like “PLDM over SMBus” or “MCTP over SMBus”?",

      "message": "Thanks for the correction.  I am new to BMC-host interaction and appreciate any ideas how to organize this.  I think the previous section should list [SMBus](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/i2c/summary.html) or (https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/UM10204.pdf)\n\nI would also like to capture protocol stacks that are implemented in OpenBMC (like \"MCTP over LPC, PCIe, UART\" above, but - help needed.",

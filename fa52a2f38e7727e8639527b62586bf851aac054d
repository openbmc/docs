Devicetrees represent the hardware, and from experience over time I think it\u0027s best that they reflect the information from the schematics without influence from software implementation choices.",

      "message": "I think this document and the proposals in it have been more work then they were really worth and there was a lot of friction with userspace dictating kernel device tree rules.\n\nBut I\u0027m not sure a comment on a review just trying to update it is the place to make a decision to deprecate it? A mailing list or TOF issue maybe? I think in the end we need to guide people towards using a standard name if possible but also encouraging openbmc userspace apps to support build-time configuration data to allow whatever the device tree for a system serves up.",

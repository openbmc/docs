# OpenBMC Anti-patterns

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern):

"An anti-pattern is a common response to a recurring problem that is usually
ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive."

The developers of OpenBMC do not get 100% of decisions right 100% of the time.
That, combined with the fact that software development is often an exercise in
copying and pasting, results in mistakes happening over and over again.

This page aims to document some of the anti-patterns that exist in OpenBMC to
ease the job of those reviewing code.  If an anti-pattern is spotted, rather
that repeating the same explanations over and over, a link to this document can
be provided.

## Anti-pattern template [one line description]

### Identification
(1 paragraph) Describe how to spot the anti-pattern.

### Description
(1 paragraph) Describe the negative effects of the anti-pattern.  Provide
statements to support your claim that the observed pattern is in fact an
anti-pattern.

### Background
(1 paragraph) Describe why the anti-pattern exists.  If you don't know, try
running git blame and look at who wrote the code originally, and ask them on the
mailing list or in IRC what their original intent was, so it can be documented
here (and you may possibly discover it isn't as much of an anti-pattern as you
thought).  If you are unable to determine why the anti-pattern exists, put:
"Unknown" here.

### Resolution
(1 paragraph) Describe the preferred way to solve the problem solved by the
anti-pattern and the positive effects of solving it in the manner described.
Provide statements to support your claims of benefit.

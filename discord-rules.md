# Discord Rules

1. This community works together to build an Open Source BMC firmware. It's a
   community expectation that you will provide access to your code in the
   course of discussions. We are unable to build together if you are unable to
   share your code. The community is not a substitute for a support contract.

2. OpenBMC community members are volunteering their time to answer your
   questions. Please keep this in mind if you are waiting for a response.

3. All support questions must be asked in public channels. Do not send
   uninvited private messages to other community members. Private requests for
   help place an unfair burden of expectation on people volunteering their
   time. Further, others in the community cannot help if they cannot see the
   question.

4. Don't post the same question in multiple channels. Doing so fragments the
   conversation. If you're unsure of which channel to use, ask your question in
   `#general` and we may redirect you elsewhere.

5. Reflect on whether your standing in the community is appropriate for the
   help you are requesting. If you are new to the community, you will likely
   have the most success by asking detailed, specific questions about detailed,
   specific problems. Vague questions by unfamiliar people often go unanswered

6. Do not discuss undisclosed bugs that may have a security impact in Discord.
   Instead, email `openbmc-security@lists.ozlabs.org` and follow the
   [documented directions][1]

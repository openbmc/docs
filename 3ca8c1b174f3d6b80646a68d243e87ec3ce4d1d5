      "message": "I see the domain, standby, was dropped from this proposal.  Is a single generic name with no indication of domain useful?  Does it result in similar fault isolation procedures regarless of which domains faulted?  (In the discussion comments the first user only latches the standby domains, including those that power the BMCitself.  I feel that is a meaninful distinction)",

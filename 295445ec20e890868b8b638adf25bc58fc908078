I am good with the agreement you have mentioned to get this work done, will continue work on implementation.\n\nPull google pam module\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/openbmc/+/73216\n\nD-bus interface commit\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/+/72602",

I\u0027m happy to review in-progress stuff, and I have access to the DMTF internals, but when designs are pushed that don\u0027t state that, I have to assume they\u0027re using existing schemas that the public can see.\n\nWhen you\u0027re creating designs in an open source project based around not yet approved things, you need to document exactly what changes you\u0027re expecting to see from the specification, so we know that\u0027s what\u0027s happening.  Not everyone has access to the DMTF github.",

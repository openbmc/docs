The rest is a lot of noise and details which distracts from the point, which is this file represents a reference set of checks, and that individual projects may vary.\n\nIf we find individual checks that we know cause issues (bugprone-exception-escape or bugprone-swapped-arguments) we could think about documenting them here in the future as a \"probably don\u0027t use\" list, rather than the list below, which encourages basically all the namespaces.",

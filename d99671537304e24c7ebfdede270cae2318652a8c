      "message": "I\u0027m not sure how much we really need to hold this up any further;  It\u0027s close enough, and so long as we get responses to the open things before code starts getting pushed, and code gets pushed in a reasonable manner (not just a single dump from https://github.com/AMDESE/amd-bmc-ras) I think I\u0027m ok with going forward.\n\nMy asks in the future:\n1. LibCPER is a common library that we should use for CPER decoding going forward.  I believe it already supports some subset of AMDs messages, so we should keep that as a common cper component.  If AMD folks want to own the AMD portion of the decode, please add yourself as reviewers going forward.\n2. I would like to see CPER storage somewhat standardized such that (similar to IPMI) we\u0027re just plugging in new CPER sources (APML, ARM SSIF, etc) rather than writing a new application every time.  This is outside of what this document is suggesting, but there\u0027s enough folks working on CPER at the moment, that this seems like a worthwhile goal.",

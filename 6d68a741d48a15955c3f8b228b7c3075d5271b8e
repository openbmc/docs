      "message": "They are basically the same on these systems.  Historically, the sequencer hw power on request would turn on all the voltages, then afterwards fw would use a \"software_pgood\" gpio to take all the chips out of reset at the same time.  However, the power sequencer hw used on these systems do both of those things, so the gpios basically both do the same thing.\n\nIMHO the gpio isn\u0027t a status... it\u0027s on output, not an input.",

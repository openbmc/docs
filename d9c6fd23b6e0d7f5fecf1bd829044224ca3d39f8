I thought you did not want ExternalStorer doing any schema manipulation on its own, but rather, obeying schemas that others had already written.\n\nI\u0027m not following the above statement, and I suspect you\u0027ve misunderstood me;  Must be \"able\" to store and produce schemas to the redfish standard.  This involves the things you\u0027ve been working on around now properties work, how collections work, ect.  This does not mean that this design needs to verify all schemas.\n\nIdeally requires should be able to become a test, and the test for this would be (that I think you\u0027ve already written) write some compliant redfish to external storer, and ensure that it can be produced correctly.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e As for security compromises, see the Impacts section for that, I called attention to the security requirements there.\n\nLets call it out in requirements, because it is a requirement, and a requirement is phrased differently, in a way where we can make clear the security intent.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e As for setting the ID, and auto-generating an ID if not provided, that\u0027s an API detail, and it\u0027s in the companion API document.\n\nDisagree, I would like it in the requirements so it\u0027s part of the test plan.  We will need to test both paths, and I would like that called out.  If you\u0027d rather add it to your test section, that\u0027s fine, but I\u0027d like it somewhere in here, because as we\u0027ve found, it\u0027s important.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e As for adding resources at any point in the Redfish tree, isn\u0027t that not allowed by schema? The point of a schema is to restrict what can be done arbitrarily, so that data remains organized.\n\n\nAgreed, so lets word it very precisely: \"Must be able to add resources to anywhere in the Redfish tree that is allowed by the standard.\"  Does that seem better?",

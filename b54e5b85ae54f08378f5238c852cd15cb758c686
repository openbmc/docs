      "message": "I mentioned before concern about having CMIS-specific APIs.  Previously, I understood CMIS to be a specific spec and we don\u0027t usually want to expose specs at a dbus level.  We don\u0027t expose IPMI, PLDM, MCTP, etc.\n\nIt would be nice if we could come up with some kind of abstraction for the underlying device that CMIS is representing and frame this in term of those kind of devices.  The hope would be if some device comes along that exposes those same concepts over PLDM that they can still plug right into the dbus model without major changes.\n\nI\u0027ve reviewed the other properties on this interface but it seems like the only one that is unique is this \"Identifier\" property.  I have a few thoughts:\n\n- Is the way the module is connected to the board really all that interesting?  Is there a hard requirement to be able to expose it outside the BMC, and if so, what value does knowing it provide you?\n\n- This feels like maybe it belongs as a subclass of Inventory/Connector.\n\n- I wonder if we have some other Decorator already with a free-form string that could be used.  If we were talking about a 3-6 entry enumeration, then an enumeration seems fine, but I don\u0027t really like these enumerations where they are a carry forward of some 2 decade old spec with 25+ elements and only 1 or 2 of them are found in modern systems.  If you look at Inventory/Item/Cpu, what we did there in a similar problem, what we did is made them a free-form string where the string values are expected to come from \"DSP0134 Section x.y.z\".",

I agree that even for me it would probably be easier to write this in user-space, but why do we bother writing anything in the kernel then?  I don\u0027t think \"it is easier to complete the feature\" is a reason we\u0027ve typically accepted and it seems like it is just opening the door for everything device oriented to avoid kernel work whenever the associated developers feel like it.",

It\u0027s hard enough to code to two different styles already, if each repo\u0027s maintainers have their own variations it\u0027s just cumbersome.  clang-tidy and clang-format certainly help address that, but I\u0027m a fan of standardization across the distribution.",

      "message": "The trouble with setting something universal is the overhead needed to bring up old projects to the new standard if we make these prefixes required. I was really hoping to just make them encouraged or allowed, so I can make my projects use them :)",

      "message": "Similarly to .clang-format being a rapid mechanism for bringing a project up to spec.  .clang-tidy can be used to fix-up code bases over time.  Many projects still don\u0027t use .clang-format and violate the style guide in many ways.  It\u0027s just a matter of not introducing new violations via automatic detection and slowly updating old code (or letting a tool update it).  That said, leaving this in the hands of maintainers requires specific language for the rest of the style -- is all of it up for grabs, or just some?",

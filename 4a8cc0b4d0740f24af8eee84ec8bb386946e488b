      "message": "I\u0027ll submit whatever is needed to openembedded, not a big deal.  I know there was a question of the base64 implementation, which has been replaced with yet another base64 implementation in the meson-dev branch that this doc will pull.\n\nMy intent once this is somewhere we can work on it is to either pull one of the existing single-file solutions already in openbmc to replace the hard dependency, or upstream the base64 recipe to open embedded.  Base64 decoding doesn\u0027t seem like the kind of thing that\u0027s worth taking a dependency on a library for such a small piece of code\n\nThe intent is not to add any recipes aside from libcper into meta-phosphor or openbmc/openbmc.",

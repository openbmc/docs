      "message": "Part of the reason we have the existing role mapping is because people need these rules to interop between IPMI and Redfish.  This design would break that mapping if redfish roles now use a totally different namespace.\n\nThis design hiccup I think needs solved, but I don\u0027t think we should hold up the overall design because of it.  I suspect this is just a missing requirement \"must be able to map IPMI roles to Redfish roles\"",

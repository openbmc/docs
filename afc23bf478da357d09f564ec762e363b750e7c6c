      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is an \"impact\" but I\u0027m ok with it being listed here.  Maybe this is an \"implication\"?\n\nWhat is it in the design that leads to this?  I don\u0027t see any words in this entire document that implies this as a necessary design intent.  I don\u0027t really even see anything about bmcweb in this whole document.\n\nIs this really an impact/implication of the design?  Or is it an existing implementation [problem?] in bmcweb?  ie. You could change the bmcweb implementation to not have this problem and we would not need any changes to this entire document, right?  So... why are we not fixing it and why do these words even belong in this document?",

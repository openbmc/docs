      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is an \"impact\" but I\u0027m ok with it being listed here.  Maybe this is an \"implication\"?\n\nWhat is it in the design that leads to this?  I don\u0027t see any words in this entire document that implies this as a necessary design intent.  I don\u0027t really even see anything about bmcweb in this whole document.\n\nIs this really an impact/implication of the design?  Or is it an existing implementation [problem?] in bmcweb?  ie. You could change the bmcweb implementation to not have this problem and we would not need any changes to this entire document, right?  So... why are we not fixing it and why do these words even belong in this document?",

      "message": "The \"leaf of the node name needs to be unique\" constraint isn\u0027t specific to this topology design change.  Sensors, Usernames, Sessions (and probably more I can\u0027t think of) also have this constraint, and have since bmcweb was ported to add DBus support years ago.\n\nI do appreciate you documenting it, and this text is valuable, lets just add it outside the scope of the topology design change.\n\nFWIW, IPMI SDRs share this same naming constraint, because the list of elements is \"flattened\" from the leaf node, so this need for a way to get a single list of user-facing names is not unique to bmcweb.",

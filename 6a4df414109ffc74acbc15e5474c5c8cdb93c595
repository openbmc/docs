It seems like adding role/privileges doesn\u0027t matter and can have no restriction.\n\nHow is modifying operation-to-privilege mappings managed? Is it just if the current use have access to PrivilegeRegistry/RoleCollection/ManagerAccountCollection then they have access? With that, can we update the role/privilege for PrivilegeRegistry/RoleCollection/ManagerAccountCollection?\n\n(not sure if that too deep into implementation detail, or need to be determine now).",

As per our discussion, i have addressed your last mentioned comments. \n\nThere is one pending item - I am going to look into the PLDM specification and add a section on how to handle multipart images where a hardware components can have multiple subsections which can be updated independently but using different sections of multi part image and hence can run different versions.

That seems like an arbitrary acronym.\n\nIs this design exclusively unique to IBM or do you intend it to be able to support other panel designs?  Have you looked at the OCP Debug Card and determined if you would be able to easily extend to support to an OCP card?\n\nIf this is IBM-only design and code, and you have no intention on this working with anyone else\u0027s hardware, please put into an IBM subdirectory.",

      "message": "Why is this called \u0027OPNL\u0027?  That seems like an arbitrary acronym.\n- YES, Just for ease of use or do i need to use IOPMA ?\n\nIs this design exclusively unique to IBM or do you intend it to be able to support other panel designs?  Have you looked at the OCP Debug Card and determined if you would be able to easily extend to support to an OCP card?\n- The way I see it , yes it is , I am not pretty sure if there will be other panels like this, seems outdated and one of a kind. Yes have looked at the OCP debug card and it did not look easy enough to plug my requirements into that, Both does things totally different and it also depends on the code within the micro. \n\nIf this is IBM-only design and code, and you have no intention on this working with anyone else\u0027s hardware, please put into an IBM subdirectory.\n- I had mailed the mailing list asking if anyone had any interest in such a thing and I had got no response. If someone else hardware is the OCP debug card , then I do nto see any easy way, but if someone wants to use the IBM operator panel or wants to design one similar to it, then they could, and since I cannot force the future in that , I placed the design here.\n\nI am hoping for you guys to steer me in the right direction.",

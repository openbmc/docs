I thought we could review the code here for now. If you feel this implementation doesn\u0027t belong in this location, please let me know how you\u0027d prefer to proceed.\n\nThanks!",

We\u0027re not going to merge this obviously but it would be helpful for him to understand the direction you are proposing.\n\nWe met as a TOF on Tuesday and agreed to create the repository.

Very similar to what we 2 paragraphs below - referring to maintainers responsibilities.\n\nMaybe something like: \"* Manually verify the contributor has signed the ICLA (individual) or is\nlisted on an existing CCLA (corporate). If the contributor is not on CLA, have them follow the process for being added in (./CONTRIBUTING.md).\"",

      "message": "nope.  Having wildcards leads to abuse, and the possibility that a serial number could change, and not get caught by the test harness.  Also, it means that the generated test files can no longer be used to build/look at an example implementation of a machine anymore, and I think that\u0027s important to be able to compare exact machines.\n\nI would be hard against any kind of fuzzy matching.  The only exception I see could be for sensors values, which are expected to vary a bit, but those are going to be a range, not a regex.",

I\u0027d probably say that how/where to get logs off the machine is out of scope for this tool.  You can specify where you want the logs to go, and the tool will write them there, be it an NFS share, an sshfs implementation, or just a tmpfs in ram, I\u0027d like the tool not to be in charge of that to keep it simple.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think we want to associate/equate the existence of a UPS with a brownout condition.  Although it is true from a BMC perspective in both cases the BMC can continue to run, brownout\u0026blackout are terms used in the industry to describe the type of power line disturbance.  Ie, a brownout or a blackout can happen with or without a UPS attached.\n\nEg, without a UPS attached, when a brownout happens, the chassis power is lost but the BMC (on standby power) can continue to run, as stated above.  However, if a UPS is attached, whether the PLD is a brownout or a blackout, in both cases the chassis power is maintained, and the system should eventually turn itself off in an orderly fashion before the UPS drains and the system crashes.\n\nSo really those are 3 separate scenarios (blackout, brownout, power loss with UPS attached) for which we want to utilize the automated power-on recovery feature (aka auto-power restart).  Hopefully that makes sense, let me know if not, thanks.",

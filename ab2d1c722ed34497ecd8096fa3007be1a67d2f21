That\u0027s unreasonable IMO, and at this point I\u0027d be happy just to make them fix that by merging the single-daemon patches.",

So this design document could be just about the one-process refactoring of phosphor-led-sysfs, which is mostly completed.\n\nThen we can adjust this design doc to only be about that, and make another one \nfor the concerns about LED Policy if we need it.\n\nIf you think that\u0027s a good idea, i can remove some stuff from this doc.\nOr someone should mark it as abandoned.",

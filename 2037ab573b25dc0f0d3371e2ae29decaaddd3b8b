I wanted to push this up and get feedback before I did that work.\n\nAlso, if you notice I picked on ‘mctp’ as an example here just because.  Jeremy probably won’t care that I did that but I probably won’t merge that way in the first go around.\n\nAgree, it would be nice to be able to migrate all the repositories to the OWNERS structure and plugin.",

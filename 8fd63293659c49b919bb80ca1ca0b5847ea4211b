      "message": "In my proposal, the inventory providers can use whatever hierarchy they want, but consumers shouldn\u0027t infer any information from that hierarchy - they would still need to rely on associations as the source of truth. These associations could be generated by phosphor-inventory-manager automatically based on what path hierarchies are specified in the configuration files, but that wouldn\u0027t be part of the initial implementation.\n\nFor the alternative design, inventory consumers would need to get information about certain types of relationships (e.g. Chassis contains/contained by) from inspecting the path hierarchy and other types of relationships (e.g. powers/powered by) from D-Bus associations. Particular types of relationships would always need to be encoded as one or the other to avoid confusion and conflicting information.",

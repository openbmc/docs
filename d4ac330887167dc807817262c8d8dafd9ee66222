The BMC may have function like IPMI firmware firewall (or the OpenBMC Phosphor host IPMI whitelist support) to restrict which IPMI commands are allowed.  The use case is a bare-metal server.\n- Underlying hardware interfaces (such as KCS and BT) are intended to provide support only for higher-level interfaces (such as in-band IPMI or PLDM).  For example, the interfaces may have functions which allow the host system to have access to the BMC (memory, buses, etc).  This level of access to the BMC is not intended and should (must?) be disabled.

(Example: must re-flash to update)\n- Replace the entire firmware image (and clear any read-write file systems).\n- Replace the entire read-only firmware image but leave read-write overlays (overlayfs).\n- All of these require the BMC to reboot.\n\nOrganizations may restrict code update to supported paths have been designed and tested together.  Here are some considerations:\n- Code update from an older to a newer release.\n- Code update from a newer to an older release (downgrade).\n- Code update to the same release, for example, to fix a corrupted image.\n- The BMC may have a mechanism to prevent unsupported updates.\n- An update may be safe to perform while the BMC\u0027s host continues to run, or it may require the BMC\u0027s host be stopped to perform safely.\n- Code update to an inappropriate release, for example, for a different model BMC.  Note that this may be detected when the firmware\u0027s digital signature is validated (provided different signing keys are used for BMCs intended for different hosts).",

Web agent connects to a server (specifically BMCWeb running with BMCWEB_INSECURE_DISABLE_CSRF_PREVENTION, but not necessarily running on the target BMC) from where it downloads Web app, then gets a session directly to a BMC, and makes REST API calls directly to the BMC.

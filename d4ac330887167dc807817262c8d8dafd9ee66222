      "message": "Add new paragraph: The BMC typically has a serial connection used as a console.  The BMC\u0027s boot loader, Linux, and system initialization provide information on and take command from this connection.  For example, see https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-phosphor/initrdscripts/files/obmc-init.sh.\nThe serial line may be connected to a console device which connects it to the network, but the nature of that connection is outside the scope of this threat model.",

      "message": "Add: How a Web agent connects to the BMC.  Options:\n A. Web agent connects directly to the BMC (specifically BMCWeb) from where it downloads the Web app; the web app creates a session to the BMC, and makes REST API calls directly to the BMC.   This is the canonical use case.\n B. Web agent connects to a server (specifically BMCWeb running with BMCWEB_INSECURE_DISABLE_CSRF_PREVENTION, but not necessarily running on the target BMC) from where it downloads Web app, then gets a session directly to a BMC, and makes REST API calls directly to the BMC.  This is a classic setup in a cross site scripting attack.\n C. Are there other configurations?  At the 2019-06-10 community call we discussed the idea of enhancing OpenBMC to support: Web agent connects to the BMC from where it downloads Web app, then gets a session directly from that BMC, and makes REST API calls directly to that BMC.  But those requests are forwarded to another BMC.",

      "message": "How would a user specify that they only want two hosts updated now and two hosts later?\nThe earlier design proposal had anew Redfish property so that the user could specify which host to update, but that section has been removed (https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/docs/+/37950/3..4/designs/multi-host-bios-update.md).\nIn this latest proposal seem that the MANIFEST would specify which hosts to update via the ImageType Bios.Rev string. Does that mean that the MANIFEST need to be updated every time the user wants to update a different combination of host instances?",

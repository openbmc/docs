      "message": "How would a user specify that they only want two hosts updated now and two hosts later?\nThe earlier design proposal had anew Redfish property so that the user could specify which host to update, but that section has been removed (https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/docs/+/37950/3..4/designs/multi-host-bios-update.md).\nIn this latest proposal seem that the MANIFEST would specify which hosts to update via the ImageType Bios.Rev string. Does that mean that the MANIFEST need to be updated every time the user wants to update a different combination of host instances?",

Do you have POC or WIP code that could be submitted to gerrit?\n\nThe reason I ask is because I have a series of patches to support dual BMC image that is probably conflict with this design. (https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/q/topic:bmc-dual-image)\n\nI would like to see your changes and check how my code could be adjust to follow your design.",

BMC UBI Code Update
==============

Two BMC Code Updates layouts are available:

 * Static, non-UBI layout - The default code update

 * UBI layout - enabled via obmc-ubi-fs machine feature

This document describes the UBI code update. The non-UBI code update can be
found here: https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/code-update.md#openbmc--host-code-update

### Steps to Update

The following are the steps to update the BMC if the UBI layout is enabled.

1. Get a UBI BMC image tar:
After building OpenBMC, you will end up with a set of image files in
`tmp/deploy/images/<platform>/`. `obmc-phosphor-image-<platform>.ubi.mtd.tar` is
the UBI BMC tar image. The UBI BMC tar image contains 5 files: u-boot,
kernel, ro, and rw partitions and the MANIFEST file, which contains information
about the image such as the image purpose and version. A MANIFEST file might
look like
```
purpose=xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Version.VersionPurpose.BMC
version=v1.99.10
```

2. Transfer the generated UBI BMC image to the BMC via one of the following
methods:
  * Method 1: Via scp: Copy the generated UBI BMC image to the `/tmp/images/`
    directory on the BMC.
  * Method 2: Via REST Upload:
  https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/rest-api.md#uploading-images
  * Method 3: Via TFTP: Perform a POST request to call the `DownloadViaTFTP`
    method of `/xyz/openbmc_project/software`.

3. Note the version id generated for that image file. The version id is a hash
value of 8 hexadecimal numbers, generated by SHA-512 hashing the version
string contained in the image and taking the first 8 characters. Get the
version id via one of the following methods:

  * Method 1: From the BMC command line, note the most recent directory name
    created under `/tmp/images/`, in this example it'd be `2a1022fe`:

      ```
      # ls -l /tmp/images/
      total 0
      drwx------    2 root     root            80 Aug 22 07:54 2a1022fe
      drwx------    2 root     root            80 Aug 22 07:53 488449a2
      ```

  * Method 2: Using the REST API, note the object that has its Activation
    property set to Ready, in this example it'd be `2a1022fe`:

      ```
      $ curl -b cjar -k https://bmc/xyz/openbmc_project/software/enumerate
      {
        "data": {
          "/xyz/openbmc_project/software/2a1022fe": {
            "Activation": "xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Activation.Activations.Ready",
      ```

  * Method 3: Calculate the version id beforehand with the version
    string contained in the image:

      ```
      echo -n "<version of image>" | sha512sum | cut -b 1-8
      ```


4. To initiate the update, set the `RequestedActivation` property of the desired
image to `Active`, substitute ``<id>`` with the hash value noted on the previous
step, this will write the contents of the image to a UBI volume in the BMC chip
via one of the following methods:

  * Method 1: From the BMC command line:

      ```
      busctl set-property xyz.openbmc_project.Software.BMC.Updater \
        /xyz/openbmc_project/software/<id> \
        xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Activation RequestedActivation s \
        xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Activation.RequestedActivations.Active

      ```

  * Method 2: Using the REST API:

      ```
      curl -b cjar -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT \
        -d '{"data":
        "xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Activation.RequestedActivations.Active"}' \
        https://bmc/xyz/openbmc_project/software/<id>/attr/RequestedActivation
      ```

5. (Optional) Check the flash progress. This interface is only available during
the activation progress and is not present once the activation is completed
via one of the following:

  * Method 1: From the BMC command line:

      ```
      busctl get-property xyz.openbmc_project.Software.BMC.Updater  \
        /xyz/openbmc_project/software/<id> \
        xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Activation Progress
      ```

  * Method 2: Using the REST API:

      ```
      curl -b cjar -k https://bmc/xyz/openbmc_project/software/<id>/attr/Progress
      ```

# However cognitive complexity != cyclomatic complexity. Therefore using the clang-tidy default value,
# as cyclomatic complexity seems to not be implemented in clang-tidy.

# [1],[2],[3] do not have to be enforced or applied project-wide yet.

# It is okay for subprojects to independently improve their code quality by adding checks.

# There are some checks which do not contribute to code quality but rather cause inconsistency.
# We want to avoid enabling those checks.


# As a ROUGH guideline:
# These are categories for which we MAY WANT to enable checks:
# - bugprone-*
# - cppcoreguidelines-*
# - misc-*
# - modernize-*
# - performance-*
# - readability-*

# And these are categories for which we MAY NOT WANT to enable checks:
# - abseil-*
# - altera-*
# - android-*
# - objc-*

# Exceptions to above may happen, use common sense :)

      "message": "I strongly prefer we maintain a single tidy file, given that there are very few repos that will remain C-only forever (including unit tests and examples).  Can you be more specific about what problems you\u0027re seeing and on what repos with the other proposed tidy file? When I\u0027ve hit this in other repos, the majority of warnings were silenced by ensuring that there were ifdef __cplusplus guards before #including a C header file.",

      "message": "Thanks, Ed. It looks like a local setup issue in my sandbox caused the mess. I was experimenting with increasing the warning level and the C standard version. and satrted seeing lot errors.\nPlease see https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/libmctp/+/86318—this keeps the same base version without any Meson changes.\nIn theory, both checks are C++‑specific and should be skipped for a C project. We can discuss",

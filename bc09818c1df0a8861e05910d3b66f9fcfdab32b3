      "message": "Does the pinhole reset poke EXTRST on the BMC?\n\nSince my previous comment Patrick pointed out that EXTRST is recorded as a reset cause in the SCU (e.g. see SCU074[1] on page 443 in ast2600v09.pdf). We could expose that through appropriate kernel interfaces which would remove the need for this GPIO? Was the reset cause capability an oversight wrt the board design?\n\nI\u0027m okay if we still define the GPIO here, just trying to resolve whether it is in-fact redundant.",

      "message": "For our p10bmc system design, the pin hole reset was wired to report that it has occurred via this GPIO. It represents a full system reset triggered by pushing the pin hole reset. We can have a discussion with Emile internally on whether future systems could utilize this SCU. It seems like a better design point to have all of the reasons in one place (i.e. the SCU in the AST2600). One of Patrick\u0027s comments on a review about the code using this pin, is who gets priority (the sysfs watchdog reason interface or the GPIO) so there\u0027s definitely a certain amount of confusion that comes with having multiple ways to report why a reboot occurred. But at this point, it seems like we are where we are with p10bmc and this GPIO needing a name.",

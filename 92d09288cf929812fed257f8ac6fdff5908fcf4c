      "message": "Overall, I don\u0027t really see a design here.  I see a lot of thoughts that neglect that this component needs to interact with:\n1. DMTF - As the publish new schemas and develop new features.  Some of these are unavailable for 6 months after merge, how is that handled if schemas are static?\n2. Implementations of Redfish that are under development, and might not have complete schemas, as well as implementations of Redfish that are not OpenBMC.\n3. OpenBMC as a whole, which has a lot of the component pieces for this already built and proven, and has OEM schemas that already exist and have history (are those supported?).\n4. Implementations of HTTP/JSON/core libraries that will be extended with new features over time.\n\nThere are lots of unanswered questions surrounding those things in this design, and the wording (maybe unintentional) makes it sound like this effort is just going to rewrite everything because DMTF/Curl/Beast/Nlohmann/bmcweb http_client don\u0027t work, but fails to specify why.  If that\u0027s not the intent, lets get that written down what core components we plan on using.\n\nOverall, I think the right path here is to start implementing the redfish-\u003estruct conversion in a gerrit review (ideally starting with the DMTF one as a base), and lets look at the generated code to see if it\u0027s something that will work.  Ideally please start with an old redfish schema, and show that new redfish schemas can be parsed without re-compiling the library against the new schemas (for at least the properties that existed at the time).  As much as I dislike it, this is a requirement that the Redfish standard places on client implementations.\n\nThe other elephant in the room is that the implementation here needs to be capable of supporting schemas that aren\u0027t published, or are only published on the systems that produce them, and duplicating those schemas to OpenBMC would violate copyrights (ie, Redfish supports more than just OpenBMC).  FWIW, I think this somewhat necessitates moving away from a compile time struct generation, and more toward Redpath, which in DTMF is intended to be the solution to this exact problem, but wasn\u0027t really mentioned in the background.  If Redpath doesn\u0027t work for this use case, ideally some feedback to DMTF is in order.",

Have we compared to the DMTF one?\n\nhttps://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Schema-C-Struct-Generator\n\nThere\u0027s lots of design questions on how this is going to work.  For example, how do you handle things that are not specified with in the schema but are in the protocol spec?  How are error codes responses handled?  How are odata identifiers (that don\u0027t show up in schema) handled?  How are features like expand (that I know was called out later in this design doc) handled when the types of a NavigationReference can potentially change the result?\n\nI agree, the idea of type safe classes certainly has a lot of appeal, but the fact that not all Redfish information is available in the schema causes some hard-to-solve corner cases.  If you\u0027re interested in my attempt, here is the last time I tried to create type safe redfish to grpc (similar problem space). https://github.com/edtanous/redfish_to_grpc\n\nThat ultimately failed because of the number of corner cases in Redfish.  I\u0027m very worried that we\u0027re going to get the easy stuff implemented (read a sensor on an existing schema version), then this daemon won\u0027t be able to actually function, or will break with every new redfish revision.  Some code examples that this can even be done correctly would be appreciated so we can look at specific requirements.\n\nFWIW, These problems are why redfish created the Redpath specification: https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0285_1.0.1.pdf\n\nWe should consider including that in the design, as it solves the problem you\u0027re trying to solve in a much more targeted way without creating dependencies on specific versions of schema",

Changes in schema versions that the client is not aware of should not break code\n2. Additional properties added should not break parsing of existing structures\n3. OEM schemas (especially incorrect ones) should not break code\n4. Must handle parsing @ identifiers and return codes in the Json response.\n5. Additional enumeration values should not break parsing.\n6. Must be capable of parsing schemas without breaking copyright (ie checking in schema files from a system the project doesn\u0027t own or have license to redistribute).\n\nBasically any one of these of these break most examples of autogenerated parsing code and FWIW is why bmcweb aggregation is designed the way it is.  I\u0027m excited to see what you can produce!\n\nMost of the above could arguably all be covered under \"Must follow the redfish specification\" but I don\u0027t like the subtlety of just saying that.",

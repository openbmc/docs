It would not make sense to have the fan marked \"Operational\" yet having the Amber LED [ON]. \n\n--------------\n\nWe have another usecase, where we need to turn off all the Indicator LEDs as part of Power_On. When we do that, we will turn off all indicator LEDs and also mark part as functional. If the part is then deemed NonFunctional, then we get into the path that I mentioned before\n\n---------------------\n\nWe have another usecase, where PHYP will detect some issue with PCIE slot for example. When they do it, they will just say turn on the LED for PCIeSlot. As part of that, we need to turn ON LED and also set OperationalStatus.  Similarly, if they are fine, then they ask to turn the LED off and by that, we also set OperationalStatus to true.\n\n-------\n\nNet: We won\u0027t have OperationalStatus as Good _plus_ also have Amber LED on.",

When we do that, we will turn off all indicator LEDs and also mark part as functional.\n\nThis is fairly unique to your system design, I suspect.  But, again, why doesn\u0027t the Fan(*) code know that we\u0027ve started a new power on and to retry all hardware?

If your hypervisor detects an error on a PCIe slot, why wouldn\u0027t they tell you they detected an error on the PCIe slot rather than a round-about way of telling you that by asking you to turn on an LED?  Can\u0027t you just assume certain requests \"turn on LED x\" really mean \"PCIe slot Y is now in a bad state\"?\n\nWho holds the OperationalStatus for these PCIe slots?  Again, my opinion is that should be the primary receiver of the request and control the OperationalStatus directly.  LED assertions are a secondary response to OperationalStatus changes.",

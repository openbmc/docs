# Host Code Update

Reference:
https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Software

Following are the steps to update the host firmware (or "BIOS"). This assumes
the host is not accessing its firmware.

1. Get a squashfs image:

- Build op-build: https://github.com/open-power/op-build
- After building, the image should be a tarball in the output/images directory
  called <system type>.pnor.squashfs.tar

2. Transfer the generated squashfs image to the BMC via one of the following
   methods:

- Method 1: Via scp: Copy the generated squashfs image to the `/tmp/images/`
  directory on the BMC.
- Method 2: Via REST Upload:
  https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/rest-api.md#uploading-images
- Method 3: Via TFTP: Perform a POST request to call the `DownloadViaTFTP`
  method of `/xyz/openbmc_project/software`.

  ```
  curl -b cjar -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
    -d '{"data": ["<filename>", "<TFTP server IP address"]}' \
    https://${bmc}/xyz/openbmc_project/software/action/DownloadViaTFTP
  ```

3. Note the version id generated for that image file. The version id is a hash
   value of 8 hexadecimal numbers, generated by SHA-512 hashing the version
   string contained in the image and taking the first 8 characters. Get the
   version id via one of the following methods:

- Method 1: From the BMC command line, note the most recent directory name
  created under `/tmp/images/`, in this example it'd be `2a1022fe`:

  ```
  # ls -l /tmp/images/
  total 0
  drwx------    2 root     root            80 Aug 22 07:54 2a1022fe
  drwx------    2 root     root            80 Aug 22 07:53 488449a2
  ```

- Method 2: This method _only_ works if there are no `Ready` images at the start
  of transferring the image. Using the REST API, note the object that has its
  Activation property set to Ready, in this example it'd be `2a1022fe`:

  ```
  $ curl -b cjar -k https://${bmc}/xyz/openbmc_project/software/enumerate
  {
    "data": {
      "/xyz/openbmc_project/software/2a1022fe": {
        "Activation": "xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Activation.Activations.Ready",
  ```

- Method 3: Calculate the version id beforehand from the image with:

  ```
  tar xfO <squashfs image tar> MANIFEST | sed -ne '/version=/ {s/version=//;p}' | head -n1 | tr -d '\n' | sha512sum | cut -b 1-8
  ```

4. To initiate the update, set the `RequestedActivation` property of the desired
   image to `Active`, substitute `<id>` with the hash value noted on the
   previous step, this will write the contents of the image to a UBI volume in
   the PNOR chip via one of the following methods:

- Method 1: From the BMC command line:

  ```
  busctl set-property org.open_power.Software.Host.Updater \
    /xyz/openbmc_project/software/<id> \
    xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Activation RequestedActivation s \
    xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Activation.RequestedActivations.Active

  ```

- Method 2: Using the REST API:

  ```
  curl -b cjar -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT \
    -d '{"data":
    "xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Activation.RequestedActivations.Active"}' \
    https://${bmc}/xyz/openbmc_project/software/<id>/attr/RequestedActivation
  ```

5. (Optional) Check the flash progress. This interface is only available during
   the activation progress and is not present once the activation is completed
   via one of the following:

- Method 1: From the BMC command line:

  ```
  busctl get-property org.open_power.Software.Host.Updater \
    /xyz/openbmc_project/software/<id> \
    xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Activation Progress
  ```

- Method 2: Using the REST API:

  ```
  curl -b cjar -k https://${bmc}/xyz/openbmc_project/software/<id>/attr/Progress
  ```

6. Check the activation is complete by verifying the Activation property is set
   to Active via one of the following methods:

- Method 1: From the BMC command line:

  ```
  busctl get-property org.open_power.Software.Host.Updater \
    /xyz/openbmc_project/software/<id> \
    xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Activation Activation
  ```

- Method 2: Using the REST API:

  ```
  curl -b cjar -k https://${bmc}/xyz/openbmc_project/software/<id>
  ```

### Patching the host firmware

Copy the partition binary file to `/usr/local/share/pnor/` on the BMC.

The partition binary file must be named the same as the partition name that
intends to patch, ex: `ATTR_TMP`.

# LED Support for OpenBMC

This document describes how to add LED support for your machine based upon the
OpenBMC [LED Architecture][led d-bus readme] document. LED group management is
done automatically for machines that support the use of the MRW and is beyond
the scope of this document.

## D-Bus

```text
Service     xyx.openbmc_project.LED.GroupManager
Path        /xyz/openbmc_project/led/groups/<label>
Interfaces  xyz.openbmc_project.Led.Group

Signals: none
Attribute: Asserted (boolean)
```

## REST

```text
PUT /xyz/openbmc_project/led/groups/<group>/attr/Asserted
```

The LED group state can be changed by setting the Asserted value to boolean 0
or 1. In the following example, the lamp_test group is being asserted...

```bash
curl -b cjar -k -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data":  1}' \
    https://${bmc}/xyz/openbmc_project/led/groups/lamp_test/attr/Asserted
```

## REDFISH

### Resource identify Operation

Starting with Redfish v2020.3, Redfish resources have
**LocationIndicatorActive** property, which is used to identify a particular
resource. This is for LED Identify operation only.

All applicable Inventory D-Bus objects would have a forward association mapping
to LED Group D-Bus object, namely:

```text
 - identify_led_group
```

All applicable LED Group D-Bus objects would have an association mapping to
inventory D-Bus object, namely:

```text
 - identify_inventory_object
```

When a `LocationIndicatorActive` GET operation is performed on the resource,
bmcweb does below operations:

- Look for an association `identify_led_group` on the Inventory D-Bus object
- If found, read the `asserted` property from the D-Bus object that is pointed
  to by `identify_led_group`

When a `LocationIndicatorActive` PATCH operation is performed on the resource,
bmcweb does below operations:

- Look for an association `identify_led_group` on the Inventory D-Bus object
- If found, set the `asserted` property on the D-Bus object that is pointed to
  by `identify_led_group`

### Representing resource faults

For representing the fault status of a resource, Redfish `Health` property is
used. All applicable Inventory D-Bus objects would have a forward association
mapping to LED Group D-Bus object, namely;

```text
 - fault_led_group
```

All applicable LED Group D-Bus objects would have an association mapping to
inventory D-Bus object, namely:

```text
 - fault_inventory_object
```

When a component fault is detected, the responsible code sets the `Functional`
property of `xyz.openbmc_project.State.Decorator.OperationalStatus` to `false`
on the Inventory D-Bus object.

When LED manager gets PropertyChanged signal, it does the following:

- Look for an association `fault_led_group` on the Inventory D-Bus object
- Turn on/off the fault LED group depending on the value of `Functional` `false`
  would mean turn ON the LED group `true` would mean turn OFF the LED group

- bmcweb already has a design to look for `Functional` property and set the
  `Health` property.

## Development Details

There are two significant layers for LED operations. The physical and the
logical. The LED Group Manager communicates with the physical LED Manager to
drive the physical LEDs. The logical groups are defined in the machine's
led.yaml file. LED Group manager consumes this and creates D-Bus/REST interfaces
for the individual LEDs that are part of the group.

### Defining the physical LED

Physical LED wiring is defined in the `leds` section of the machine's [device
tree][kernel arm dts]. See the [Palmetto DTS][palmetto dts led] as an example.

_Add a fault LED to the device tree with a corresponding gpio pin..._

```dts
  leds {
    compatible = "gpio-leds";

    fault {
      gpios = <&gpio ASPEED_GPIO(N, 2) GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
    };
  }
```

_The kernel will then create..._

```text
 ls -l /sys/class/leds/fault/
total 0
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root          4096 Jun 21 20:04 brightness
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             0 Jun 21 20:29 device -> ../../../leds
-r--r--r--    1 root     root          4096 Jun 21 20:29 max_brightness
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root             0 Jun 21 20:29 power
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             0 Jun 21 20:04 subsystem -> ../../../../../class/leds
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root          4096 Jun 21 20:04 trigger
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root          4096 Jun 21 20:04 uevent
```

### Defining Groups

An LED Group can contain zero or more LEDs and is defined in the machines
[led.yaml][led yaml]. The default one will likely need to be tailored to your
machines layout. Customized yaml files are placed into the machines specific
Yocto location. As an example:

```text
meta-ibm/meta-palmetto/recipes-phosphor/leds/palmetto-led-manager-config/led.yaml
```

The parent properties in the yaml file will be created below
`/xyz/openbmc_project/led/groups/`. The children properties need to map to an
LED name in `/sys/class/leds`.

In the example, below two URIs would be created:
`/xyz/openbmc_project/led/groups/enclosure_fault` and
`/xyz/openbmc_project/led/groups/lamp_test`. Both act on the same physical LED
`fault` but do so differently. The lamp_test would also drive a blink signal to
the physical `power` LED if one was created.

```yaml
EnclosureFault:
  fault:
    Action: "On"
    DutyOn: 50
    Period: 0
lamp_test:
  fault:
    Action: "Blink"
    DutyOn: 20
    Period: 100
  power:
    Action: "Blink"
    DutyOn: 20
    Period: 100
```

### Required Groups

OpenBMC Architecture requires specific LED Groups to be created and are
documented in the [D-Bus interface][led d-bus readme].

## Yocto packaging

1. Create a tailored LED manager file

   E.g.
   `meta-ibm/meta-romulus/recipes-phosphor/leds/romulus-led-manager-config-native.bb`

   ```bitbake
       SUMMARY = "Phosphor LED Group Management for Romulus"
       PR = "r1"

       inherit native
       inherit obmc-phosphor-utils
       inherit obmc-phosphor-license

       PROVIDES += "virtual/phosphor-led-manager-config-native"

       SRC_URI += "file://led.yaml"
       S = "${WORKDIR}"

       # Overwrites the default led.yaml
       do_install() {
           SRC=${S}
           DEST=${D}${datadir}/phosphor-led-manager
           install -D ${SRC}/led.yaml ${DEST}/led.yaml
       }
   ```

2. Change your machine's preferred provider for the led-manager in the conf file

   E.g. `meta-ibm/meta-romulus/conf/machine/romulus.conf`

   `PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/phosphor-led-manager-config-native = "romulus-led-manager-config-native"`

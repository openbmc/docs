PLDMd is one such example which can handle update for wide variety of PLDM devices, which can have different pre and post conditions. Also, for same device type pre and post conditions can change depending upon the platform type and where that particular component is positioned.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Since the pre- and post-condition is device specific.\n\npre and post systemd targets can be device specific too.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Can you provide any specific example of a use-case for the pre- and post-update target that can or should not be solved inside the device-specific update daemon.\n\nAs i mentioned above, PLDMd is such an example which handles update for all PLDM devices and pre \u0026 post conditions for devices can be different depending upon the platform type.",

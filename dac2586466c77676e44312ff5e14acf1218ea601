      "message": "I like the sentiment overall, but one thing I would note about OpenBMC is that a lot of actions ARE irreversible, or aren\u0027t reversible without herculean effort: libpldm, having to fork the webui because of early design decisions, bmcweb legacy rest mode that we still have to keep, because folks still use it, and we have no way to measure usage across the project.  Security vulnerabilities add another avenue to this, because they essentially CAN\u0027T be a two way door.  The minute a SEVERE vulnerability is injected, the project is at risk.\n\n\"action\" takes a lot of forms, and IMO, \"merge to master\" isn\u0027t the action we need to talk about.  I\u0027ve seen \"bias for action\" used to justify drops in quality and maintainability, because \"action\" is required, and I think the bias for action framework alone misses a lot of the other leadership principles that keep it in check.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not going to use this IPMI feature on my systems but high level, it seems like you\u0027re really intertwining the host and BMC firmware here. Why not keep it generic where host just sends a \"I reached this point\" like it does with BootProgress and have the time and duration calculations all done on the BMC? i.e. why does the host need to be tracking all this timing info between steps now?",

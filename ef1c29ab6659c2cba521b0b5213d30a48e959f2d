      "message": "I reviewed this a bit;  I don\u0027t feel like a design doc is the right medium for this discussion.  It leads to this doc which is VERY abstract in its application on how this applies.  It makes some mention that this will be applied to bmcweb, but as the bmcweb maintainer, I really don\u0027t think i understand how this is going to help.\n\nit\u0027s also really not clear how it relates to: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/63609 if at all, which shows that these kinds of approaches lead to corner cases or code breakages.\n\nOverall, i would not be in support of giving a repository, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s required to start this coding project.  Just pick a repository, make a folder where your library code will go, and show how this design can give less complexity and overall code.  Once we have some examples of this being done, it\u0027s a lot easier to look at concretely rolling this out.\n\nYou\u0027ll note that in the history, we have plenty of examples of large changes (python -\u003e c++ for example) that had no design doc, but were executed one at a time, by iterating and making the code better, faster, and less buggy.  I suspect that\u0027s the right approach here.",

Please look at [dumserver](https://github.com/abhilashraju/chaibeast/blob/main/dump_server/dump_server.cpp)  to see how this framework will be used. \n\nRight, you\u0027ve chosen a threading model (similar to Apache rather than an async model (similar to nginx).  There are tradeoffs between the two, and there are certainly bmcs that go the route you\u0027ve gone.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e If you talking about the listening socket. Then you are partially correct. It uses an infinite loop waiting for new connection (but it does it asynchronously).I was a bit lazy in fixing it. \n\u003e \n\u003e It was an experimental project ,where I tried to mix Boost ASIO and std::exec , which have two different ideas about how to schedule work. \n\nCool.  I love to see the experimentation.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Since there is already work going on in the direction of std::exec and coroutines(I did not see any proposal so far), this project can be example for “what must not be done or what  must be done” when you mix asio and std::exec together.\n\nCool.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I would prefer simpler code with affordable performance than highly optimised complicated code with unnecessary performance gains.\n\u003e Judging the performance just by reading the code may not be correct. We should test it and prove it. Don’t speculate performance. \n\nI made no statements about performance.  FWIW, things like sailfish took a similar approach to the one you\u0027re taking.  you might look at those for inspiration.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I would set necessary performance bench mark, writer simpler code, test against bench mark, try to optimise the code if needed.\n\nSounds like a good plan.",

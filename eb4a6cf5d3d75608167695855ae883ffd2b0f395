This causes I have to push the design spec to other patch set as the discussion in discord. https://discord.com/channels/775381525260664832/867820390406422538/1356653363835572264\n\nThe new patch set is pushed in https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/docs/+/79327\n\nSummary about the change in new design set which relates your concerns in the comments in this patch set.\n\n+ I change to use `IsBootStrap` flag in `User.Attributes` D-Bus interface to identify bootstrap account instead of add new userGroups.\n+ `InterfaceNames` configurations will be moved to BMCWeb configuration. \n+ Phosphor-host-ipmid will be updated to support add user with only `redfish` userGroup.\n\nWith these change, the security risk will be reduced.",

I\u0027m not understanding enough of the wording under Proposed Design to know what the changes are.\n\nI don\u0027t really understand today why we chose {\"Priority\": \"Blink\"} as a meaningful configuration (because it is not a \"priority\" anyhow), but what would making a group \"Blink\" mean?  It doesn\u0027t seem like that solves what you\u0027re trying to solve, so maybe you mean to have something else for the Priority value?",

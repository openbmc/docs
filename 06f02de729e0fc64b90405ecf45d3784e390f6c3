Tools like blackduck decompose the file and analyze its readonly file system content.  For example, the tool detects which version of OpenSSL is present.  The tool then matches the OpenSSL package version against known vulnerabilities in that version and gives a report of the CVEs which might be in your firmware image.\n\nThe idea being proposed here is to use semantic versioning for all openbmc applications, to help security responders know which vulnerabilities are in their image.",

If that is your intention, please make sure it is reflected in the words you\u0027ve written.\n\nWho is going to maintain that?  I have no interest in modifying the semantic version in each application on every commit.  I don\u0027t think repository maintainers are interested in taking on yet another manual operation.  Is this something we\u0027re just going to inject in the bitbake side of things?  If so, how would it map back to a commit in the repo?",

      "message": "This seems kinda messy, and still requires bmcweb to have system specific code.  The ASCII version of an IBM system is generated differently than the ASCII version for many other systems system (which would be a lookup table.)\n\nWhat if instead of this, we just add a new field the the PostCode property called \"text\".  If the field is empty, bmcweb is free to assume no representation exist.  If the field is filled, bmcweb can assume that it was filled in properly, without needing to implement system-dependent decoding logic.",

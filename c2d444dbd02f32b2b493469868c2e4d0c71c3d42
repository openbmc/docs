      "message": "I understand libpldm had usage outside the BMC and is actually used in BIOS side work.  How is the library used for anything except a BMC?\n\nBased on what sounds like the scope, a total of 4 encode/decode functions, I\u0027m not seeing a good justification for the overhead of a \"library\".  Why should we use a worse language (which means someone is going to write a C++ wrapper around it in dbus-sensors anyhow) and all the overhead of a \"library\" to make other BMC implementations easier?\n\nWe have an architecture on OpenBMC of \"libraries are rare\".  I\u0027m not seeing enough words here to me to justify going against that architecture.",

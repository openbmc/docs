FWIW, a lot of the checks go by two different names (cert-* specifically), so I don\u0027t want to bifurcate conversations to two different reviews if one of those comes up.\n\nTo some extent, these are the checks that subproject groups have already (even if implicitly) agreed on in some of the larger repos (bmcweb, dbus-sensors).  If we break it up, we lose that this is essentially the same list that\u0027s already use today and we know to be functional.  So if it\u0027s ok, I\u0027d really prefer not breaking it up.  If other folks don\u0027t want to use the existing check list as a starting point for this review, we can go a different route.",

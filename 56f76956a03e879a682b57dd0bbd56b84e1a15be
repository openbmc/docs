      "message": "Hi Hao Jiang, thanks for the proposal. It sounds like we\u0027re missing support for a few NVMe use-cases in OpenBMC and that you\u0027d like to resolve that. Great!\n\nI\u0027ve added some comments around how I think we can work this document to help describe what it is you need. I think that can only be achieved by addressing some structural issues with the text, so -1 for now.",

The problems should be discussed in terms of use cases. What function elsewhere in an OpenBMC system would be requesting the GetLogPage or Identity functions? Why?\n3. The description should cover deficiencies in existing support for NVMe drives in OpenBMC, specifically phosphor-nvme and nvmesensor from dbus-sensors\n\nAs a part of dealing with 3, if there\u0027s a reason either of those components *shouldn\u0027t* contain the support you need, then that also needs to be covered, and argued in the \"Alternatives Considered\" section (the fact the entire content of \"Alternatives Considered\" is \"Stated in the above chapter\" is a bit of a red flag for me in terms of how you\u0027ve structured your argument here).\n\nIMO the first time we should hear about \"nvmed\" is in the \"Proposed Design\" section.",

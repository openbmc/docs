In addition , the terminology used in the PLDM and SPDM specifications can sometimes be quite extensive, which makes it difficult to translate directly into code. If we simplify or alter the terms/symbol names just to pass length checks, it can become challenging to maintain a clear mapping to the original specifications.",

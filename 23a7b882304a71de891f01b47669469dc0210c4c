      "message": "I had a similar experience running into issues when I tried enabling this on PLDM, and encountered similar challenges while working with SPDM as well. In addition , the terminology used in the PLDM and SPDM specifications can sometimes be quite extensive, which makes it difficult to translate directly into code. If we simplify or alter the terms/symbol names just to pass length checks, it can become challenging to maintain a clear mapping to the original specifications.",

      "message": "\u003e As a side note, one thing asio-based repos suffer from is overly large inline lambdas. cognative comlexity and length checks do not take those\ninto account when measuring line count, and in some cases seem to\nactively disable the checks, so even if we were able to enable these\nchecks, as implemented in clang they\u0027re not useful in a lot of scenarios\ntoday.\n\nYour argument goes like \"The check for problem A is not useful because it does not work right in presence of problem B. So we can remove the check for problem A\".\n\nThen just remove problem B. It needs to be removed anyways.\n\nFor the rest of the functions without inline lambdas, it works right, so it has value there.\n\nFrom a compiler perspective, inline lembdas could be seen as separate functions. So maybe the tooling does work right with that interpretation.",

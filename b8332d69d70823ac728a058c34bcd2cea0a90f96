If you intended to use \"start-wherever-you-want index counting\" this is problematic.  Suppose \u0027cable0\u0027 is missing.  The IPMI provider will have no way of knowing if \u0027cable0\u0027 is missing because the FRU its connector belongs to wasn\u0027t detected or because it wasn\u0027t defined for this system; thus it has no way to know if it should skip 0 in the bit-mapping.",

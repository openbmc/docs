If you have concrete changes to this design doc that would make that more clear, I\u0027m happy to add them, but I had thought that was apparent by me requesting this repository in OpenBMC.  I can\u0027t control where people outside of OpenBMC put their code or what modifications they make (nor would I want to).",

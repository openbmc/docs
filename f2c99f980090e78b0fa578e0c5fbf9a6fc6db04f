      "message": "I don\u0027t think anyone expects everyone listed in a CLA to be an active contributor.  There are many people listed in CLAs that are not active contributors.  Is that OK?\n\nFYA the org member list was a big hassle to maintain, just because of the number people involved.  Also, GitHub doesn\u0027t allow delegating this, so you have to be an organization owner to add/remove members.  So I stopped doing it.\n\nI don\u0027t think we have a use case for making people org members other than showcasing their involvement.  But this is a lot of work to enable that.  I think we\u0027d be better served publishing individual contributor metrics that highlight who is doing a bunch of work.\n\nWould a more suitable role/table entry be\n\n `code contributor | none | executed CLA | merged code`",

Yes, I need to add some text to make this clear.\n\nThe v1 spec is actually public now (https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-gpu-accelerator-management-interfaces-v1-pdf), will update this doc.\n\nAs you see in the v1 spec (section 3.6), there are 2 ways to compose request messages (and responses) by device vendors in order to be compliant with the OCP spec - PCIe ID based and IANA based. Further, you can see that the command code itself can be vendor specific. Of course, there is the option to define certain command codes in the OCP spec itself and have the IANA set to OCP itself - this would be useful to avoid duplication of work to define commands for telemetry that are common to multiple vendors.\n\nWhat this means is: the code in this repo will correspond to either a public release of the OCP base spec or the public release of an OCP base spec compliant vendor spec (in which case the code could reside in a vendor/\u003ccompany\u003e directory).",

That makes a lot more sense to me than OpenBMC + proprietary BMCs.\n\nIs anyone from AMD interested in collaborating on this library?  Is anyone making a custom ML training chip interested in collaborating?  If not, this is just Nvidia?\n\nI mentioned this above about vendor support, but I\u0027d be much more comfortable with this if there is true industry interest in collaborating here (partially because the \"competitors\" can better help keep the code in line with community expectations).  We\u0027ve had enough history with vendor-specific playgrounds in this community that I don\u0027t want to encourage new ones.",

At that point, the overhead we\u0027re spending here to even review this document, let alone create an entirely new [C] library with all the overhead of a \"stable API\", etc. just doesn\u0027t seem to justify this.

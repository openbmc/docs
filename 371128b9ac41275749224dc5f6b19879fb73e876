      "message": "keeping the list of groups in var/lib I agree with.\n\nI\u0027m not sure about files with the paths being in /var (in rwfs), as I am concerned that it might be difficult to add additional paths in one of the groups.\n\nA counter proposal, based on something I\u0027ve had in mind for ages but never implemented, is to have the groups as seperate files in a directory.   The update script couuld be modified to process all lines from all files in this directory, or all files with a given suffix, or just process the combined list, and have the init script combine all files when starting but keep the component files for this new daemon to customize the reset.  (If we use a required suffix then files could be removed from the list by renaming the file and restored by renaming it back).  (If we choose to have the lines consolidated, we could have the default script cat all components).\n\nUsing files each with a group of names would allow the files required to be moved to individual packages over time.",

And ... we haven\u0027t added any requirements when going this route.\n\nThis should be our worst-case, but when we go this route we need to have some requirements / commitments from the external repository.  For example:\n\n- we cannot have them re-writing git history once we add them.\n- we need to have some kind of SLA commitment on fixing issues induced by newer compilers (especially if any machine in our CI system is leveraging these recipes).",

We don\u0027t want a spider web of dependencies.  If someone wants to change, for example, phosphor-dbus-interfaces we need to be able to apply the appropriate changes across all our repos and not have to go to other organizations in order to get CI passing.",

      "message": "Probably a coincidence - Just an FYI - Intel has recently proposed Bulk telemetry proposal using the existing specs like PLDM Platform monitoring and control (dsp0248) + PLDM for file transfer (DSP0242) in DMTF, It\u0027s still in discussion, but that seems like a little better approach rather than building a new packet.\n\nWas there any attempt by you guys to scale the pldm protocol for bulk telemetry ? what\u0027s the reason for building a new spec rather than improving what we already have ?",

      "message": "Aware of the same (we have also been involved in and contributed to those discussions). I am one of the authors of DSP0242.\n\nIt is not just about bulk telemetry and file IO though. PLDM T2 is not yet ready to be used across devices for all telemetry use-cases. Someday it will get there. Until then, the purpose of the OCP spec is to unify device telemetry protocols to run on top of MCTP with a common OCP header, which can be extended by vendors.",

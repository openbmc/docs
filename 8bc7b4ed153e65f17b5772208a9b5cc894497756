      "message": "This design is intended to address limitations in existing boot progress reporting mechanisms that rely on real-time delivery — such as IPMI over SMBus or SSIF — where boot codes can be lost if the BMC is not yet fully initialized or responsive when the host begins transmitting them.\n\nIn contrast, the proposed approach uses host-maintained, hardware-backed circular queues to log boot progress and error codes asynchronously. This allows the BMC to retrieve the complete set of boot events after it becomes available, ensuring no data is lost due to boot timing mismatches.\n\nBy decoupling the host’s boot logging from the BMC’s runtime state, this design improves reliability, especially in scenarios where the host firmware begins execution before the BMC is fully online",

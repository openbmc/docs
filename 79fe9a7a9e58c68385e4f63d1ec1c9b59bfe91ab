You said it wouldn\u0027t require root permissions in the requirements above.  So, that means you now have to switch the application-under-test to use the user bus in these special test cases.\n\n- Service names need to be unique per-bus.  We have had problems with applications spawning dbus services in testing because we run the builds in parallel.  You can get a machine with multiple jobs running at the same time, some of which expect to use (or mock) the same service name.  We\u0027ve fixed that in test-cases by often adding some random number to the reserved service name, but now you\u0027re again not testing the real connection between the applications-under-test.\n\n- The most widely used dbus service is mapper.  You will want a \"real\" mapper for your test environment because that is how many applications get to the service they really want and we don\u0027t want duplicate copies of mapper mocks in every repository.",

Metric thresholds should use the existing Sensor.Threshold objects and someone else might come along later and refactor Sensor.Threshold across all implementations.\n\n2. We create separate Metric.Threshold interfaces that more model how we [Ed] would like to see thresholds and someone can refactor Sensor.Thresholds later.\n\n3. We create a new Sensor.Threshold structure, which Metrics will use, that aligns with this new thinking and mark the old interfaces as Deprecated.\n\nI am fine with any of these 3 directions, but I would weakly be opposed to #2.\n\nWhatever we do I think there is the question of \"what happens to the existing Sensors exposed by phosphor-health-monitor\" which I don\u0027t see clearly spelled out in this document.  There is already some bmcweb code (and probably phosphor-host-ipmi also) that can handle the existing \"Sensors\".  Are we keeping those?  Are we removing those?

      "message": "Thanks for the design. You have a bunch of different audiences to satisfy with this document, so I appreciate the difficulty in choosing what information to put in.\n\nThe questions I would like to see answered are:\n\n - How will you develop this without breaking the build? Will there be an opportunity for having some daemons protected by selinux, or is it a permissive/enforcing binary switch for the entire system?\n\n - I imagine you have a reference platform you will implement first. It would be useful to document how other developers would go about enabling selinux for their platform, which may run a different set of userspace tools\n\n - It would be useful to provide some metrics on filesystem usage and runtime impact once you have started implementation, to guide other developers on enabling this for their systems.",

It might be easier to restrict this design to *enabling* SELinux so it can be used in permissive mode, and stop there.  Then a follow-on design or updating this design can then talk about customizing policy files for OpenBMC for switching to enforcing mode.",

Also, how do you advise BMC system integrators to obtain and use the log analysis tools?  Can they be built separately via Yocto bitbake, or can we get them from somewhere else?",

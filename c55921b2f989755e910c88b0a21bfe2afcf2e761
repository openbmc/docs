You have a bunch of different audiences to satisfy with this document, so I appreciate the difficulty in choosing what information to put in.\n\nThe questions I would like to see answered are:\n\n - How will you develop this without breaking the build? Will there be an opportunity for having some daemons protected by selinux, or is it a permissive/enforcing binary switch for the entire system?\n\n - I imagine you have a reference platform you will implement first. It would be useful to document how other developers would go about enabling selinux for their platform, which may run a different set of userspace tools\n\n - It would be useful to provide some metrics on filesystem usage and runtime impact once you have started implementation, to guide other developers on enabling this for their systems.",

The TOE refers to the BMC, and the TSF refers to the BMC\u0027s security functions (including access controls such as Linux permissions, and ACLs).]\n\n\u003e FPT_ITT ... provides requirements that address protection of TSF data when it is transferred between separate parts of a TOE across an internal channel.\n\nMy interpretation is that FPT_ITT requires that we protect data (like new account creation) as it is transferred between different processes within the BMC, like data passed via D-Bus APIs (such as when new users are created via IPMI or Redfish).\n\nPutting that all together, the access controls provided by SELinux will help the BMC comply with requirements to protect security data as it flows through D-Bus interfaces within the BMC.",

      "message": "this seem to be a poor approachpproach.  nether of these are physical, they are both dynamically asigned each boot.\n\nThe contents of this decorator would have to be probed and dynamically evaluated each boot.\n\nIf you want an inventory decorator you should identify either the physical inentoriy item eg the adaptor  card in the corresponding pci slot and the port (eg sfp port) and deccorate that.  the ncsi address is formed by the rmii conection to the ncs-si port (not sure if redfish has this covered), the package strappinig (which should be a variable passed to the instance of the package as there are straps to select which of 3 package id is used), and the channel number (which is likely a fixed assignment for a given adapter and likely NIC).  (I\u0027m not confirming the redfish names at this hour but know there are logical and physical entities)\n\n\nBottom line, I think the computation of this inventory decorator is not trivial and should be hosted somewhere; either an application or a library to walk inventory interfaces.  possibly several simple decorators and probably 1 or more associations will be needed to identify the package and port although I could see both when the package is a passed variable analogous to $bus for i2c)",

While I had lots of questions to those since I hadn\u0027t read ncsi 1.2 at the time and understood less of mctp, pldm and their layering, my chief concern was how it was going to integrate with and not conflict with the kernel NC-SI stack.\n\nDo you have patches for kernel nc-si to allow sending and reciving RMII correction NC Block Data?   Note that kernel support is required if the kernel stack is required because of how the anti-replay works (and last i checked only OEM messages were permitted to be generated from a netlink).  (Yes I\u0027ve seen the userspace netlink-util patches but not the kernel)  Prevviosly I was assuming the users were using something like the  gbmc userspace nc-si stack.\n\n\n(Note: having read and understood the nc-si spec and some of the linux network driver / interface architecture I have thoughts on how to rewrite it to truly support the spec but its about item 4 on my major projects hobby list).",

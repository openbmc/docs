      "message": "\u003e Also - since daemon code is starting to get submitted to Gerrit, have you already pushed a new interface YAMLs to phosphor-dbus-interfaces for discussion there?\n\nDid not push anything there, since the design is still being discussed. If the dbus interface descriptions are unclear, that\u0027s a review concern i can try to resolve.\n\n\u003e If not, I\u0027d recommend doing that sooner than later, since all kinds of discussion can happen around small details there.\n\nIf people approve my design here (which already includes the dbus interfaces) and then reject it later in the PDI repo, then i should probably just resign and look for a simpler job.\n\n\u003e In my own daemon\u0027s case, I spent waaaay too much time debating with folks over how to name the thing, then when I finally polished and submitted it, it got an almost immediate \"no way we\u0027re doing any of that, use an existing interface\"\n\nThat\u0027s unfortunate. From my experience, design documents are the way to go to get agreement on something from multiple people, then implement it. It\u0027s a slow process but practical in the many-repository environment.\n\nbtw thanks for your review and feedback :)",

      "message": "I spoke to Ed about this after attempting to legitimately use these instructions to get going with Qemu / OpenBMC development. He assured me this documentation is out of date and overly difficult, and subsequently showed me the `source oe-init-build-env build` and `runqemu nographic` workflow.\n\nTo address your comments, I have now moved the lost material to the sdk readme.",

      "message": "First of all..... I told you that there were still people that used the SDK, so we probably shouldn\u0027t delete that section......  Sorry, but the \"Ed says\" thing triggered me a little ðŸ˜„\n\nI haven\u0027t looked at these docs, but Cody is essentially documenting the improvements that Yocto has made to this workflow, and should still meet the use cases for most people, but if there are concerns about changing, we could leave the \"old\" qemu workflows around, and note that they might not be the most efficient given that yocto has first class qemu support these days, including building and running it with a minimum of boilerplate.\n\nJust thinking out loud.  FWIW, the commands cody is replacing are what I\u0027ve been doing for some time, and remove a lot of the complexities out of these instructions, at least for me.",

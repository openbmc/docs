      "message": "I\u0027m struggling a bit with this one. If we put it under the xyz.openbmc_project.State.Chassis interface, then we\u0027d have to have the phosphor-state-manager chassis application host this. So we\u0027d have it hosted by state-manager but controlled by phosphor-psu-monitor? It feels like it fits well here but it seems weird that some other app will be setting the property. Should we host this under a separate interface? xyz.openbmc_project.Status.Chassis maybe? Or should we just say state-manager hosts it and leaves Undefined and it\u0027s up to psu-monitor to set?",

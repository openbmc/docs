      "message": "The word \u0027Polarity\u0027 does not make much sense to me when looking at multiple values. \n\n\u0027Polarity\u0027 can be either active-high or active-low. For example a reset pin can be active-low, meaning when it has value 0 / is pulled down, the chip is in reset.\n\nSo the reset is \u0027active\u0027 during that time.\n\n\nIn our case, the values from multiple gpios are considered together and each combined value has a meaning. So there is no \u0027active\u0027 state there and no pin which is \u0027active low\u0027 or \u0027active high\u0027.",

      "message": "What about systems that want to retain the current behavior of skipping scanning on an entire bus?  With this design it seems like they\u0027d have to explicitly enumerate all the addresses on that bus -- I think there should be some sort of provision for allowing that to be expressed concisely.  Two options I can see offhand:\n\n - have the \"addresses\" key map to either an array of addresses like you\u0027ve got for an explicit list, or the string \"*\" to mean \"all addresses\"\n \n - leave the top-level \"buses\" key as-is (an array of bus numbers to skip entirely), and add your new more fine-grained structure as a separate entry under its own key (e.g. \"bus-addresses\" or something).\n \nThe latter would have the advantage of also be backwards-compatible, so I think it would probably be the better option.",

      "message": "If you\u0027re addressing a specific SMC communication issue, a daemon might be effective. However, for the broader challenge of REST/HTTPs/Redfish communication, it seems to add unnecessary complexity and reduces flexibility. Relying on a single application for all communications introduces a single point of failure. Additionally, the need for type-safe classes for Redfish schemas may stem from this added layer of indirection between the application and server. The two reasons you mentioned for a Redfish client daemon—reusability and security—are already addressed in the industry through HTTP libraries, OpenSSL, and various server-specific authentication and authorization methods.",

      "message": "How do we handle Message Registries from the SMC?\n\nThere are a few bit issues I see:\n\n- SMC has its own set of Registries from the BMC, such as OEM registries from the SMC vendor.  How does the BMC aggregate so that these registries can be obtained from the vendor?\n\n- What happens if for some reason the SMC has advertised the same registry as the BMC but has different content?  The BMC is going to forward events that might not match the published registry that it gave out.\n\n- What happens if the BMC and SMC have different versions of the same registry?  This potentially has conflicting information such as the order of MessageArgs.",

But just like Andrew rephrased:\n\nThe async task calls read to the file and write the retrieved part to the socket (data is read in small parts), these 2 actions are repeated until the desired length is reached, as long as the socket is ready for each write. Meanwhile, the client listens on the client socket for the data. So we can say data are automatically read from host by pldmd after Open() is called by the client. The only factor that can affect the possibility of the next part reading to Host is the readiness of the socket.\n\nRephrased it to a better sentence. Does it address the concern?",

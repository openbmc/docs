      "message": "Yes.  We would need to set the license on this file to match what the upstream is.  Documentation often has a different license than code.  Doc/process/license-rules.rst has a SPDX: GPL-2.0.  I don\u0027t see anything on coding-style.rst, so we have to assume GPL.  I\u0027m not really sure what GPL means for documentation though.",

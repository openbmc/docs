      "message": "Does this need to be changed with the discussion on PS4 around how sockets deal with the TO bit? When would we use connect() with TO\u003d0? I think the tag provided to connect() needs to be checked against the terminus set associated with the socket().\n\nconnect()ing in order to send a response on a socket on which we\u0027ve also called bind() seems heavy-handed when send{to,msg}() exist, but maybe we shouldn\u0027t preclude it? I think allowing it requires that the subsequent send*() calls be provided with the same tag and TO in their metadata (i.e. we error out calls that don\u0027t meet that requirement).",

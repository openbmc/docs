What are the ramifications of that?  Are we ready to make that leap?\n\nYou can make a design public by posting it on the mailing list or in a fork of OpenBMC.  What specifically are you looking to accomplish by instead putting them in this repository, in oem/ibm?",

      "message": "To me, this kind of feels like our move away from the independent OEM repos (ibm-dbus-interfaces, intel-dbus-interfaces, ...) and all into a single repo. I\u0027d like to see designs from other companies for functions my company doesn\u0027t have. It provides perspective and could be a ah-ha moment where we realizes there\u0027s a collaboration opportunity on something similar. We could put in a separate fork or on the mailing list...but the first does not get much visibility to the community, and the second rarely happens for whatever reason (a certain portion of our community still isn\u0027t real comfortable with the mailing list).\n\nI think a lot of these OEM functions have potential to be something that could move into OpenBMC proper, it\u0027s usually a time and resource debate. And why put the effort in if there isn\u0027t someone else interested in the function...yet.\n\nI think high-level, yes anyone from any company could put designs in a oem sub-directory. The more designs the better in my opinion :) \n\nBut, I don\u0027t have any strong feelings here. We could definitely keep these in a fork of the repo. TOF question? Mailing list poll maybe?",

But specifically, you want to see them _here_ - in this repository, and not elsewhere.\n\nWhat I am looking to understand is how these designs impact developers.  Lets say I want to make an architectural change for one reason or another, and the way ecmd is integrated into OpenBMC would be impacted by my change.  Is there an expectation that as I do my work, I consider how ecmd is integrated and fix the documentation?  Or is that up to the owners of the OEM folder, in this case IBM?\n\nI hope the problem with the former is obvious - this doesn\u0027t scale and will cause the project to stagnate.  If it is the latter, I\u0027m fairly sure that information will become stale and misleading in short order, which really hurts project newcomers.  I\u0027m not calling out IBM specifically - I\u0027m thinking about the general case, myself included, if we open the floodgates to anyone and everyone.\n\nWhatever the answer is, I think we should spell that out in a README in the OEM folder.\n\n\u003e TOF question?\n\nProbably.\n\n\u003e Or why does this need separate maintainership?\n\nThe answer to this really depends on the answer to my question above - what is the expectation on developers when these documents are impacted by the work they do.\n\n\u003e I worry if OpenBMC says company-specific documents shouldn\u0027t go in the docs/ repo, there will be common requirements that don\u0027t get pushed upstream. :/\n\nIf you assume that people will not use the mailing list to talk about the work they are doing, then yes I understand this concern.",

      "message": "\u003e Are the maintainers of the docs/ repo tired of reviewing these oem docs?\n\nI asked Andrew to create this based on [1] and the flurry of design documents related to that effort, most of which were placed under some \u0027/ibm/\u0027 subdirectory.\n\nI have no idea how we want to handle this effort.  I don\u0027t have the bandwidth to review every design document in this space.  The majority of these designs are not applicable to anyone except this one weird IBM design, so I can\u0027t even see most maintainers wanting to devote resources to reviewing these designs.  On top of that we haven\u0027t even begun to have a discussion of what the code impacts of this are and if we even want to maintain the aspects of this design in the rest of the code-base.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/openbmc/6497C254-2BB5-4545-B251-A87AE6A5B503@gmail.com/\n\nPersonally, if IBM wants to use this subfolder as a collaboration point among themselves, I have no issue with it.  That\u0027s why I suggested this commit be made.\n\nIt should be very clear that any design \"accepted\" here does not mean there is community consensus on them.  I\u0027m expecting the IBM team to distill out the pieces that are going to impact the rest of the code-base and populate them as a non-OEM design.",

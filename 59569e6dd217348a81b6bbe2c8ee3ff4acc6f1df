What are the ramifications of that?  Are we ready to make that leap?\n\nYou can make a design public by posting it on the mailing list or in a fork of OpenBMC.  What specifically are you looking to accomplish by instead putting them in this repository, in oem/ibm?",

      "message": "To me, this kind of feels like our move away from the independent OEM repos (ibm-dbus-interfaces, intel-dbus-interfaces, ...) and all into a single repo. I\u0027d like to see designs from other companies for functions my company doesn\u0027t have. It provides perspective and could be a ah-ha moment where we realizes there\u0027s a collaboration opportunity on something similar. We could put in a separate fork or on the mailing list...but the first does not get much visibility to the community, and the second rarely happens for whatever reason (a certain portion of our community still isn\u0027t real comfortable with the mailing list).\n\nI think a lot of these OEM functions have potential to be something that could move into OpenBMC proper, it\u0027s usually a time and resource debate. And why put the effort in if there isn\u0027t someone else interested in the function...yet.\n\nI think high-level, yes anyone from any company could put designs in a oem sub-directory. The more designs the better in my opinion :) \n\nBut, I don\u0027t have any strong feelings here. We could definitely keep these in a fork of the repo. TOF question? Mailing list poll maybe?",

      "message": "\u003e I\u0027d like to see designs from other companies for functions my company doesn\u0027t have.\n\nOf course.  But specifically, you want to see them _here_ - in this repository, and not elsewhere.\n\nWhat I am looking to understand is how these designs impact developers.  Lets say I want to make an architectural change for one reason or another, and the way ecmd is integrated into OpenBMC would be impacted by my change.  Is there an expectation that as I do my work, I consider how ecmd is integrated and fix the documentation?  Or is that up to the owners of the OEM folder, in this case IBM?\n\nI hope the problem with the former is obvious - this doesn\u0027t scale and will cause the project to stagnate.  If it is the latter, I\u0027m fairly sure that information will become stale and misleading in short order, which really hurts project newcomers.  I\u0027m not calling out IBM specifically - I\u0027m thinking about the general case, myself included, if we open the floodgates to anyone and everyone.\n\nWhatever the answer is, I think we should spell that out in a README in the OEM folder.\n\n\u003e TOF question?\n\nProbably.\n\n\u003e Or why does this need separate maintainership?\n\nThe answer to this really depends on the answer to my question above - what is the expectation on developers when these documents are impacted by the work they do.\n\n\u003e I worry if OpenBMC says company-specific documents shouldn\u0027t go in the docs/ repo, there will be common requirements that don\u0027t get pushed upstream. :/\n\nIf you assume that people will not use the mailing list to talk about the work they are doing, then yes I understand this concern.",

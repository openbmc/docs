      "message": "Some boards have a GPIO presence along with EEPROM available to the BMC. One potential is to have the GPIO optionally probe the board\u0027s presence even if that board\u0027s EEPROM is corrupted, so we could detect the difference between \"board not presence\" vs \"board eeprom corrupted\".\n\nThis feature could potentially probe said inventory with an \"unknown\" value.",

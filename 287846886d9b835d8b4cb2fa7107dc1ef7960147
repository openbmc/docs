We write a gpio_defs.json file, and it maps the SoC GPIO names (B6, H4, AA3 etc) to the appropriate names defined in the GPIO code (SYS_PWROK_BUFF, SOFTWARE_PGOOD, BMC_POWER_UP etc).\n\nUnless you\u0027re planning to patch the GPIO code in libopenbmc_intf to add support for devicetree GPIO names, I don\u0027t think we need this patch. If that is what you\u0027re planning, then given you\u0027re patching the code anyway I think we could at least settle on some reasonable names here and include the new naming as part of your patches.\n\nIf it\u0027s not what you\u0027re planning then I think we just leave the code as it is and eventually lay it to rest. I\u0027m kinda surprised that it hasn\u0027t been replaced yet anyway.",

      "message": "While I understand what you were trying to do here, This probably needs to go in the exposes section.\n\nThe physical device \"exposes\" a port interface.  The dbus interfaces themselves should be generated internally.  This keeps our principal of \"EM config files are writable by someone without experience with dbus\" intact.  Even with what you\u0027ve written there, I\u0027d have to go look up PDI to know what needs to go in those.\n\nAlso, FWIW, I suspect that we\u0027re going to need to append information to this at some point, with things like presence GPIO pins that we\u0027ll need implementations to fill in\n\nwhat about\n\nExposes: [\n   {\n       PortType: BackplaneConnector,\n       I2cLaneIndex (optional): $BUS,\n       PresencePinName (optional): PortAGPIO,\n       Type: PhysicalPort,\n       Name: BackplanePortA.\n   }\n]\n\nThen that gets us:\n1. An extension point where we can handle arbitrary ports on a device, just by adding new \"PortType\" options.\n2. As we find new exciting use cases, we can add properties\n3. A way for a user to provide a sane name for their entry that makes sense for their system, and can differentiate this topology from another.  For example, a baseboard is going to have PCIeSLots, sata connectors, U.2 connectors, and a bunch of other stuff.  This solves most of the use cases.",

      "message": "I think this linking is good.\n\nPer the previous comment, I think this becomes\n\nExposes: [\n   Type: DownstreamPort\n   PortType: BackplaneConnector\n}\n\n\nWhich, in theory if we have the i2c bus information from the previous exposes, IN THEORY, we could just implicitly generate one if we find an Entity on a declared bus number, because we know that the parent is a \"port\", so if this thing is plugged into that i2c device, we don\u0027t need any additional information about the port type on the device, we know from the parent resource.\n\nWith that said, in terms of initial implementation, this is fine.",

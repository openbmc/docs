      "message": "The \"rather\" part isn\u0027t really in line what what LF says.\n\nIt allows for both if it\u0027s required.\n\n\"Please note that it is not wrong, and it is acceptable, if a contributor wishes to keep their own copyright notices on their contributions.\"\n\nAnd I think that if we pull code from anywhere else that already has a copyright, we need to retain that, so this would require all code to be \"new\" code.    I personally don\u0027t care that much, but there\u0027s companies where they make this requirement (arbitrarily) and I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a reason to disallow a contribution.  With that said, if we have something where LF says \"no company copyrights\" then that\u0027s easy to point to an authority and not be inventing our own policy here.\n\n\nI think this doc should express a requirement for Copyright OpenBMC authors, and a preference for not including the per-company names, without explicitly disallowing it.",

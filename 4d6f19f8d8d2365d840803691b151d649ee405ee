I personally don\u0027t care that much, but there\u0027s companies where they make this requirement (arbitrarily) and I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a reason to disallow a contribution.  With that said, if we have something where LF says \"no company copyrights\" then that\u0027s easy to point to an authority and not be inventing our own policy here.\n\n\nI think this doc should express a requirement for Copyright OpenBMC authors, and a preference for not including the per-company names, without explicitly disallowing it.",

      "message": "See the “Why not list every copyright holder?” section. We are allowed, per LF, to ask them not be added. They give a number of rationales but the two most important to me, as a maintainer, is:\n\n\u003e * Trying to keep notices up to date, or to correct notices that have become inaccurate, increases the burden on developers without tangible benefit.\n\u003e * Developers and maintainers often do not want to have to worry about e.g. whether a minor contribution (such as a typo fix) means that a new copyright notice should be added.\n\nI’m ok adding something about “code copied from elsewhere” but we should be clear that “copied from elsewhere” means somewhere in open source and not a “internal codebase we are contributing to the project”.",

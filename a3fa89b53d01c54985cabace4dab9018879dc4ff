      "message": "Idea to add to this design: Have a way at compile-time to configure the mapping from privilege-role to group-roles used for dynamically  created users.  For example, the Bitbake recipe would specify that users created with the \"admin\" privilege-role also get the following group roles: ssh, ipmi, redfish, web.\nHowever, note that OpenBMC does not have a supported way to modify a user\u0027s group roles and  this design does not propose to add that function.  (You can modify a user\u0027s groups via BMC shell access as the root user.)",

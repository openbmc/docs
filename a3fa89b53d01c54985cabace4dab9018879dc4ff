      "message": "Idea to add to this design: Have a way at compile-time to configure the mapping from privilege-role to group-roles used for dynamically  created users.  For example, the Bitbake recipe would specify that users created with the \"admin\" privilege-role also get the following group roles: ssh, ipmi, redfish, web.\nHowever, note that OpenBMC does not have a supported way to modify a user\u0027s group roles and  this design does not propose to add that function.  (You can modify a user\u0027s groups via BMC shell access as the root user.)",

      "message": "Do we need a way to ensure the \"admin\" account cannot be deleted?  In other words, is this account built-in or is it pre-created?\nIMHO, it is cleaner to treat pre-created accounts as regular accounts.\n\nOn the other hand, I have a use case for a built-in account that cannot be deleted, namely the built-in \"service\" account that gives the manufacturer special privileged access to the system.  See https://github.com/ibm-openbmc/dev/issues/1737\n\nIs there a better way to do this?",

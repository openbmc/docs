Were do the acceptable and possible values of this field get documented?  Translation at the external interface level is a huge issue, but it also tends to create tight-coupling between your code and some consumer and that coupling is often machine-specific (since only your machine will have sub-units A, B, and C).\n\nIf you have a sub-unit of a FRU (or device) that you want to perform guard on, my suggestion would be to add the sub-unit to the inventory model.  We do this already for processor cores, so why not any other unit?  If it is a unit specific to IBM or even a specific processor generation, put it in the `com.ibm` namespace.",

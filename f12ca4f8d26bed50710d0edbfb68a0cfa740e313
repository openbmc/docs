      "message": "I get that you don\u0027t want to do a major refactor without knowing the exact values, but without merged examples of this making a portion of the codebase better, it\u0027s really hard to approve a blanket value.\n\nAs written, if all of these checks were enabled on the repos, they\u0027d cause hundreds of errors in CI logs, which would cover up real failures and make reviews much more difficult.\n\nConsidering that the ipmbbridge refactor says in the commit message that it isn\u0027t recommended to be merged because it probably causes bugs, I\u0027m not sure how we would apply this to larger repos.\n\nAll in all, I\u0027m all for simplification, lets start working on the refactoring, and figure out what the tradeoff is in actual code that we can merge.  If we can confidently say \"setting the max line length to X results in better OpenBMC code\" and we have some merged reviews to back that up, that\u0027s fine.",

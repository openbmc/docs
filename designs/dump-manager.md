## Problem Description

During a crash or a host failure, an event monitor mechanism generates an error
log, but the size of the error log is limited to few kilobytes, so all the data
from the crash or failure may not fit into an error log. The additional data
required for the debugging needs to be collected as a dump. The existing OpenBMC
dump interfaces support only the dumps generated on the BMC and dump manager
doesn't support download operations.

## Glossary

- **System Dump**: A dump of the Host's main memory and processor registers.

## Background and References

Various types of dumps are created based on the type and source of failure. The
dump manager, which is orchestrating the collection and offload, needs to
provide methods to create, store the dump details, and offload it. Additionally,
some sources allow the dump to be extracted manually without a failure to
understand the current state or analyze a suspected problems.

### Type of dumps supported.

These are some of the dumps supported by dump manager.

#### BMC Dump

A dump collected when there is a failure in the BMC with various debug
information. This type of dump can be generated by user too to get the current
state of the BMC. This dump gets collected on BMC and stored on BMC

#### System Dump

A system dump is a collection of debugging information from the host, this may
include host memory and/or register data. This dump can be initiated by BMC and
there can be system reboots while collecting the dump. Dump gets stored in the
host memory and offloaded through the BMC or get collected directly to BMC based
on the size of dump contents and the available space on the BMC to store the
dump.

#### Resource dump

A special type of host dump is initiated and collected by the host based on the
request from a user. No system state change may be necessary during the
collection of this kind of a dump. A resource indicator may be used to indicate
what data to be collected. The content of the dump can be decided by the host.
This dump can be stored in host memory and offloaded through BMC or host can
send this dump down to BMC once the collection is completed based on the size of
the dump and the availability of space on the BMC.

#### Hostboot dump

A dump that can be collected during the boot failure of the host. This dump may
or may not include the contents of the main memory and/or the processor
registers.

#### Hardware dump

This dump can be collected during a critical failure on the hardware components
like the processor while the host is booted and running. The host may stop
during this dump and may collect various processor states and/or memory contents
to help to debug the failure.

## Requirements

![Dump use cases - Users are examples, not a mandatory part of implementation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16666879/70888651-d8f44080-2006-11ea-8596-ed4c321cfaa6.png)

#### Dump manager needs to provide interfaces for

- Create a dump: Initiate the creation of the dump, based on an error condition
  or a user request.
- List the dumps: List all dumps present in the BMC.
- Get a dump: Offload the dump to an external entity.
- Notify: Notify the dump manager that a new dump is created.
- Delete the dump.
- Mark a dump as offloaded to an external entity.
- Set the dump policies like disabling a type of dump or dump overwriting
  policy.

## Proposed Design

There are various types of dumps; interfaces are standard for most of the dumps,
but huge dumps which cannot be stored on the BMC needs additional support. This
document will explain the design of different types of dumps. The dumps are
classified based on where it is collected, stored, and how it is extracted. Two
major types are

- Collected by BMC and stored on BMC.
- Collected and stored on an attached entity but offloaded through BMC.

This proposal focuses on re-using the existing
[phosphor-debug-collector](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-debug-collector),
which collects the dumps from BMC.

#### Brief design points of existing phosphor-debug-collector

- A create interface which assumes the type is BMC dump and returns an ID to the
  caller for the user-initiated dumps.
- An external request of dump is considered as a user-initiated BMC dump and
  initiate BMC dump collection with a tool named dreport with type manual dump
- The dreport create dump file in the dump path provided by the dump manager
  code.
- A watch process is forked by the dump manager to catch the signal for the file
  close on that path and assume the dump collection is completed.
- The watch process calls an internal dbus interface to create the dump entry
  with size and timestamp.
- The path of dump is based on the predefined base path and the id of the dump.
- When the request comes for offload, the file is downloaded from the dump base
  path +id, no update in the entry whether dump is offloaded
- Deleting a dump by deleting the entry and internal file also will be deleted.
- There are system generated dumps based on error log or core dump, which works
  similar to user-initiated dumps with the following difference.
- No external create D-Bus interface is needed, but a monitor application will
  monitor for specific conditions like the existence of a core file or a signal
  for new error log creation of a few selected types.
- Once the event occurred, the monitor will call an internal D-Bus interface
  dump manager to create the dump with the type of dump.
- The dump manager calls dreport with a dump type got from the monitor and write
  data to a path based on dump id.

#### Updates proposed to the existing phosphor-debug-collector.

- External D-Bus interface needs to specify the type of the dump since a user
  can request multiple types of dumps
- Create will be returning an id which can be mapped to the actual dump once it
  is created.
- A Notify interface is provided for notifying the creation of a dump outside
  the BMC but offloaded through BMC.
- The InitiateOffload function will be implemented to download the dump.
- Status of the dump, whether offloaded or not, will be added to the dump entry.

### Dump manager interfaces.

- Dump Manager DBus object provides interfaces for creating and managing dump

- Interfaces

  - **Create**: The interface to create a dump, called by clients to initiate
    user-initiated dump.

    - AdditionalData: The additional data, if any, for initiating the dump. The
      key in this case should be an implementation specific enum defined for the
      specific type of dump either in xyz or in a domain. The values can be
      either a string or a 64 bit number. The enum-format string is required to
      come from a parallel class with this specific Enum name. All of the Enum
      strings should be in the format
      'domain.Dump.Create.CreateParameters.ParamName'. e.g.: { "key1": "value1",
      "key2": "value2" } ends up in AdditionaData like: ["KEY1=value1",
      "KEY2=value2"]

  - **Notify**: Notify the dump manager that a new dump is created.
    - ID: ID of the dump, if not 0 this will be the external id of the dump
    - Type: Type of dump that was created.
    - Size: Size of the dump

### Dump entry interfaces

    -  **InitiateOffload**: Initiate the offload of the dump.
        - OffloadUri: The URI where the dump should be offloaded.

#### The properties common to all dumps

There will be a base dump entry with properties common to all types of dumps

- ID: Id of the dump
- Timestamp: Dump creation timestamp
- Size: Total size of the dump
- OffloadComplete: Set to true when offload is completed
- OffloadURI: The URI for offloading the dump, set while initiating the offload.
  Specific types need to inherit from this common dump entry class and add
  specific properties.

#### Additional propertries based on dump types

##### BMC Dump

- No Additional properties

##### System Dump

- External Source ID: ID provided by the Host, this id will be used for all
  communication to the source of the dump, in this case, Host.

### Flow of dumps collected and stored in the Host

PLDM is provided as an example dump transport and notification mechanism between
Host and BMC.

- Create: Initiate methods to create the dump in Host.
- Generating the dump in Host
- Host notifies the creation of dump through PLDM to BMC.
- PLDM call Notify to create the dump entry
- InitiateOffload: Dump manager request Host to start offload
- The Host sends the dump through PLDM, and PLDM on BMC sends it out.

## Alternatives Considered

- Offloading Host dumps through Host instead of BMC, but considered BMC option
  due to following reasons - The BMC is considered the "management path" of most
  servers and often the Host is not connected to the desired network for the
  offload location. - BMC provides one common point for all dumps generated in
  the system for external management appliance.

## Impacts

- The existing BMC dump interface needs to be re-used. The current interface is
  not accepting a dump type, so a new interface to create the dump with type
  will be provided for BMC dump also without changing the existing interface.
- Modifying the BMC dump infrastructure to support additional dumps.
- openpower-proc-control will be updated to call memory preserving chip-ops and
  to handle memory preserving reboot on POWER platforms.
- Additional system state to indicate the system is collecting debug data While
  performing memory preserving reboot.

## Testing

- Unit tests to make sure the dump manager interfaces are working.
- Following integration tests will be executed to make sure the dump manager is
  working as expected. - Test creating host dumps and offloading it. - Test
  deleting host dumps - Create/List/Offload/Delete BMC dumps to make sure
  existing dump manager functions are not broken.
- Automated tests for dump Create/List/Offload/Delete to avoid regression.

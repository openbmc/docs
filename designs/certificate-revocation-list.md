# Certificate Revocation List on BMC

## Problem Description

This design is to add management interfaces for certificate revocation list in
OpenBMC.

## Background and References

A certificate revocation list (CRL) is a list of digital certificates that
have been revoked by the issuing certificate authority (CA) before their
actual or assigned expiration date. In Google, there are use cases that BMC
needs to install CRLs to the Redfish server, so that clients with revoked
certificates will be rejected in TLS handshake. Supporting CRL is also
recommended in most applications.

Current OpenBMC certificate management architecture contains two main
components.

1. [phosphor-certificate-manager](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-certificate-manager)
owns certificate objects and implements management interfaces; currently
there are three types of certificates supported: client, server, and
authority.

2. [BMCWeb](https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb): the Redfish front-end which
translates certificate objects into Redfish resources. BMCWeb is also a
consumer of these certificates; it uses certificates in its TLS handshake.

DMTF doesn't support CRLs yet in the Redfish spec. Adding them is WIP. See
[this discussion](https://redfishforum.com/thread/618/resource-certificate-revocation-list?page=1&scrollTo=2173).
Google doesn't plan on using Redfish interfaces to manage certificates and
CRLs. Instead, Google has a dedicated daemon for credentials installation,
and this daemon interacts with the OpenBMC certificate management
architecture via DBus APIs.

## Requirements

OpenBMC supports management interface for CRLs:

1. clients shall be able to install/delete/replace CRLs via DBus APIs
2. whenever CRLs change, the certificate management system shall notify
consumers which use old CRLs to refresh with the newly given CRLs
3. other daemons, e.g., BMCWeb shall consume CRLs the same way as existing
authority/server/client certificates, that is, via file path or directory
determined at compile time.

## Proposed Design

### phosphor-dbus-interfaces

We propose to introduce a new interface `CRL` in [Certs](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/tree/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Certs).

Because no Redfish spec is available, we propose the only attribute of the
interface to be `CRLString`, which contains the PEM encoded CRL. We can add
more attributes as needed in the future.

### phosphor-certificate-manager

We propose to add a new type of certificate-manager (CRL-manager) to the
existing three types of Manager.

The CRL-manager will implement the following common interfaces:

1. [InstallAll](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Certs/InstallAll.interface.yaml):
install multiple CRLs and notify consumers. The notification process is
the existing behaviour which phosphor-certificate-manager uses to tell
consumers to reload newly installed credentials.

2. [ReplaceAll](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Certs/ReplaceAll.interface.yaml):
replace all existing CRLs with multiple new CRLs and notify consumers

3. [DeleteAll](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Collection/DeleteAll.interface.yaml):
delete all existing CRLs and notify consumers

### BMCWeb

We propose to introduce CRLs into BMCWeb's SSL Context. Whenever BMCWeb
reloads, it not only refreshes authority and server certificates, but also
CRLs. Example codes can be found in many opensource projects, e.g., this
[snippet](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/blob/master/lib/base/tlsutility.cpp#L338).

## Alternatives Considered

We can model the whole CRLs list as a single object, but that's not aligned
with the existing authorities list design.

## Impacts

1. New DBus interfaces
2. More complete security support

## Testing

Add new unit tests in phosphor-certificate-manager.

Manual integration tests: install CRLs and verify clients' revoked
certificates are rejected.

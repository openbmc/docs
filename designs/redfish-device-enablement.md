## Problem Description

(1 paragraph) What are we doing and why? What problem are you trying to solve?
What are the goals and NON-goals? Please make the objective understandable for
someone unfamiliar with this project by including the necessary context, but
keep it short. Elaborate on the details below in the Background and Requirements
sections.

## Background and References

(1-2 paragraphs) What background context is necessary? You should mention
related work inside and outside of OpenBMC. What other Open Source projects are
trying to solve similar problems? Try to use links or references to external
sources (other docs or Wikipedia), rather than writing your own explanations.
Please include document titles so they can be found when links go bad. Include a
glossary if necessary. Note: this is background; do not write about your design,
specific requirements details, or ideas to solve problems here.

## Requirements

(2-5 paragraphs) What are the constraints for the problem you are trying to
solve? Who are the users of this solution? What is required to be produced? What
is the scope of this effort? Your job here is to quickly educate others about
the details you know about the problem space, so they can help review your
implementation. Roughly estimate relevant details. How big is the data? What are
the transaction rates? Bandwidth?

## Proposed Design

(2-5 paragraphs) A short and sweet overview of your implementation ideas. If you
have alternative solutions to a problem, list them concisely in a bullet list.
This should not contain every detail of your implementation, and do not include
code. Use a diagram when necessary. Cover major structural elements in a very
succinct manner. Which technologies will you use? What new components will you
write? What technologies will you use to write them?

## Alternatives Considered

(2 paragraphs) Include alternate design ideas here which you are leaning away
from. Elaborate on why a design was considered and why the idea was rejected.
Show that you did an extensive survey about the state of the art. Compares your
proposal's features & limitations to existing or similar solutions.

## Impacts

API impact? Security impact? Documentation impact? Performance impact? Developer
impact? Upgradability impact?

### Organizational

- Does this repository require a new repository? (Yes, No)
- Who will be the initial maintainer(s) of this repository?
- Which repositories are expected to be modified to execute this design?
- Make a list, and add listed repository maintainers to the gerrit review.

## Testing

How will this be tested? How will this feature impact CI testing?

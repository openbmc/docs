## Problem description

The platform is a collection of fundamental hardware and firmware components
needed to boot and operate a system. The Platform Firmware Resiliency(PFR)
in NIST SP 800-193 provides technical guidelines and recommendations
supporting resiliency of platform firmware and data against potentially
destructive attacks.

Currently Redfish schema's defined by DMTF doesn't cover properties or
resources to represent the PFR provisioned and locked states.

This document covers the new OEM properties under ComputerSystem resource
to represent the PFR provisioning status such as platform firmware is
provisioned or not as well as provisioning is locked or not. This also covers
the Redfish OpenBMC message registry metadata for logging events associated
with PFR.

## Background and references

Platform Firmware Resilience technology in NIST SP 800-93 provide common
guidelines to implementers, including Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)
and component/device suppliers, to build stronger security mechanisms into
platforms. Server platforms consist of multiple devices which must provide
resiliency by protecting, detecting and recovering platform assets. Management
controller running on server platform can be used to indicate the status of
resiliency and event logs associated with it.

## Requirements

High level requirements:

  - BMC shall provide the way to represent Platform Firmware Resilience
    provisioning status over Redfish.

  - Event logs should be logged to redfish for Platform Firmware Resilience.

## Proposed design

Different OEM's has there own way of implementing the Platform Firmware
Resilience by using guidelines provided by NIST SP 800-193. Some of the
component protected under this includes(not limited) ES/SIO, BMC/ME Flash,
Host Processors, Trusted Platform Modules(TPM), PSU's, Memory etc...
For example Intel uses the "Intel PFR" design to resiliency platform
components.

NOTE: This document doesn't cover design aspects of how OEM's implements
the Platform Firmware Resilience. It covers only generic redfish ComputerSystem
OEM properties and Redfish message registry metadata entries which are
implementation agnostic.

OpenBMC is moving to Redfish as its standard for out of band management.
The bmcweb implements all the Redfish schema's to represent different
properties and resources. ComputerSystem schema doesn't cover the properties
associated with Platform Firmware Resilience but it provides OEM objects for
manufacturer/provider specific extension moniker.

Below are property is defined to represent the Platform Firmware
Resilience provisioning status.

  - ProvisiongStatus: The value of this property indicates the provisioning
    status of platform firmware. It is of Enum Type with below values.

    1) NotProvisioned: Indicates platform firmware is not provisioned.
       This is an unsecured state.

    2) ProvisionedButNotLocked: Indicates that the platform firmware is
       provisioned but not locked. So re-provisioning is allowed in this
       state.

    3) ProvisionedAndLocked: Indicates that the platform firmware is
       provisioned and locked. So re-provisioning is not allowed in this
       state.

PFR enabled platforms can provision or re-provision the platform resilience
multiple times when it is in "NotProvisioned" or "ProvisionedButNotLocked"
states. But once the platform is transitioned to "ProvisionedAndLocked" state,
it can not be re-provisioned.

New OemComputerSystem schema can be found at
[link](https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/#/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/24253/)

PFR in OpenBMC must support logging of resiliency error detection and
correction. Below are two metadata entries in redfish message registry
for redfish event logging capability. For more details on how to log redfish
events can be found at document [Redfish logging in bmcweb
](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/redfish-logging-in-bmcweb.md).

Below type of events should be logged as part of PFR or provisioning. These
redfish events are created for basic firmware components BIOS, BMC, CPLD and
ME and must be extended whenever new firmware modules are supported under PFR.

  1) Platform Firmware Resiliency Errors:
     This is used to log the platform firmware resiliency errors.

     MessageID's:
       - BIOSFirmwareResiliencyError
       - BMCFirmwareResiliencyError
       - CPLDFirmwareResiliencyError
       - MEFirmwareResiliencyError
     Severity: Critical

     Below are some cases, where firmware resiliency error events logged
     for specific components.
       - Boot failure
       - Update Failure

  2) Platform Firmware Panic reason:
     This is used to log the reason for platform firmware panic.

     MessageID's:
       - BIOSFirmwarePanicReason
       - BMCFirmwarePanicReason
       - CPLDFirmwarePanicReason
       - MEFirmwarePanicReason
     Severity: Warning

     Below are some cases, where these events can be logged.
       - Boot time watchdog expired
       - Firmware authentication failure

  3) Platform Firmware Recovery reasons:
     This is used to log the reason for last platform firmware
     component recovery.

     MessageID's:
       - BIOSFirmwareRecoveryReason
       - BMCFirmwareRecoveryReason
       - CPLDFirmwareRecoveryReason
       - MEFirmwareRecoveryReason
     Severity: Warning

     Below are few cases, where these events can be logged.
       - Launch failures
       - Update failures
       - Authentication failures

Event logs associated with BMC component is specified here as example.
```
    MessageEntry{"BMCFirmwareResiliencyError",
                 {
                     "Indicates BMC firmware encountered resilience error",
                     "BMC firmware resiliency error. Error reason: %1.",
                     "Critical",
                     1,
                     {
                         "string",
                     },
                     "None.",
                 }},
    MessageEntry{"BMCFirmwarePanicReason",
                 {
                     "Indicates the reason for last BMC firmware panic.",
                     "BMC firmware panic occurred due to %1.",
                     "Warning",
                     1,
                     {
                         "string",
                     },
                     "None.",
                 }},
    MessageEntry{"BMCFirmwareRecoveryReason",
                 {
                     "Indicates the reason for last BMC firmware recovery.",
                     "BMC firmware recovery occurred due to %1.",
                     "Warning",
                     1,
                     {
                         "string",
                     },
                     "None.",
                 }},
```

## Testing

Provisiong status:

  - User can provision the PFR in OEM specific way and test using below URI
    and Method. Intel uses "Intel PFR" design (via BIOS) to provision and
    lock the PFR provisioning status.
```
URI: /redfish/v1/Systems/system
METHOD: GET
RESPONSE:

{
  "@odata.context": "/redfish/v1/$metadata#ComputerSystem.ComputerSystem",
  "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/system",
  "@odata.type": "#ComputerSystem.v1_6_0.ComputerSystem",
  ...................
  ...................
  "Description": "Computer System",
  "Oem": {
    "OpenBmc": {
      "FirmwareProvisioning": {
        "ProvisioningStatus": "NotProvisioned"
      }
    }
  },
  ...................
  ...................
}
```

Event logs:

  - User can induce security attack and validate the panic event logs as well as
    recovery mechanism using below URI.

    Few examples to attack Firmware components and validate PFR:

     1) Corrupt the BMC/BIOS etc... firmware and check Panic events and recovery
        actions events.

     2) Induce hardware watchdog trigger using known methods and check.
     etc..

     3) Corrupt the security key's by directly mocking hardware and validate.

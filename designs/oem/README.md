# OpenBMC OEM Documentation

The OEM design subdirectory is a location for companies to put designs
specific to their systems that do not currently fit well under a common
OpenBMC function. It is expected that the company creating the designs will
create their own OWNERS file and be in charge of reviews and merging.

Keeping these designs in a common area provides a consistent location for the
OpenBMC community to understand different companies requirements and provide an
avenue to potential collaboration.

The OpenBMC community is not responsible for ensuring changes made in the
community code base adhere to or support these designs.

**Designs under this directory do not imply community agreement or approval.**

# Design Guidelines - *Delete this section*

* Not all new features need a design document. If a feature can be
  contributed in a single reasonably small patchset that has little impact
  to any other areas, it doesn't need a design discussion and documentation.
* The focus of the design is to define the problem we need to solve and how it
  will be implemented.
* This is not intended to be extensive documentation for a new feature.
* You should get your design reviewed and merged before writing your code.
  However you are free to prototype the implementation, but remember that
  you may learn of new requirements during the design review process that
  could result in a very different solution.
* Your spec should be in Markdown format, like this template.
* Please wrap text at 79 columns.
* Please do not delete any of the sections in this template.  If you have
  nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None
* To view your .md file, see: https://stackedit.io/
* If you would like to provide a diagram with your spec, ASCII diagrams are
  required.  http://asciiflow.com/ is a very nice tool to assist with making
  ASCII diagrams.  Plain text will allow the review to proceed without
  having to look at additional files which can not be viewed in Gerrit.  It
  will also allow inline feedback on the diagram itself.

## Problem Description
(1 paragraph) What are we doing and why? What problem are you trying to
solve? What are the goals and NON-goals? Please make the objective
understandable for someone unfamiliar with this project by including the
necessary context, but keep it short. Elaborate on the details below in the
Background and Requirements sections.

## Background and References
(1-2 paragraphs) What background context is necessary? You should mention
related work inside and outside of OpenBMC. What other Open Source projects
are trying to solve similar problems? Try to use links or references to
external sources (other docs or Wikipedia), rather than writing your own
explanations. Please include document titles so they can be found when links
go bad.  Include a glossary if necessary. Note: this is background; do not
write about your design, specific requirements details, or ideas to solve
problems here.

## Requirements
(2-5 paragraphs) What are the constraints for the problem you are trying to
solve? Who are the users of this solution? What is required to be produced?
What is the scope of this effort? Your job here is to quickly educate others
about the details you know about the problem space, so they can help review
your implementation. Roughly estimate relevant details. How big is the data?
What are the transaction rates? Bandwidth?

## Proposed Design
(2-5 paragraphs) A short and sweet overview of your implementation ideas. If
you have alternative solutions to a problem, list them concisely in a bullet
list.  This should not contain every detail of your implementation, and do
not include code. Use a diagram when necessary. Cover major structural
elements in a very succinct manner. Which technologies will you use? What
new components will you write? What technologies will you use to write them?

## Alternatives Considered
(2 paragraphs) Include alternate design ideas here which you are leaning away
from. Elaborate on why a design was considered and why the idea was rejected.
Show that you did an extensive survey about the state of the art. Compares
your proposal's features & limitations to existing or similar solutions.

## Impacts
API impact? Security impact? Documentation impact? Performance impact?
Developer impact? Upgradability impact?

## Testing
How will this be tested? How will this feature impact CI testing?

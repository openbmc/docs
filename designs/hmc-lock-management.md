## Problem Description

The Hardware Management Console (HMC) is a hardware appliance that can be used
to configure and control one or more managed systems. As single HMC(multiple
sessions)/Multiple HMC's can possibly control same resource, we need some sort
of locking scheme across all the HMC's so that we can avoid collision between
multiple requests.

As BMC is the central entity across multiple HMC's, the lock management feature
should be implemented with in BMC itself. This document focuses on various
design considerations that were thought off and also the dbus interface for lock
management.

## Background and References

Hardware Management Console (HMC) is a Physical / Virtual appliance used to
manage IBM Systems including IBM System i,IBM System p, IBM System z, and IBM
Power Systems. HMC supports command line (ssh) as well as web (https) user
interface and REST API. Using an HMC, the system administrator can manage many
systems and partitions. It can also be used for monitoring and servicing a
system.

More details about IBM's proprietiery Hardware management console can be found
in below links :

## Requirements on Lock

- Every lock request asked by HMC should be uniquely assigned with a ID(used by
  the management console to debug),called as RequestID .
- There should be a provision to obtain either a write lock (which is acquired
  if a resource is to be modified) or a read lock (which is acquired if the
  resource is to be read).
  - There should a provision to obtain multiple read locks on same resource.
  - Multiple write locks on same resource should not be valid.
  - Read lock on reasource which is write locked should not be valid.
  - Write lock on resource which is read locked should not be valid.
- There should be a provision to obtain multi-level locks (parent and child
  locking mechanism), so that we should be able acquire lock for all/some
  resources which are under another resource.

## Example of Multi level structure for Locking

## Requirements on Multi Level Locking

- There should be a provision to not lock all resources under current resource level.
- There should also be a provision to Lock all resources under current resource level.
  This flag is used to acquire the lock on all the children under a parent resource
  Example:
  - Lock all the children under CEC, which implicitly locks the processor, memory,
    partitions and the pysical I/O adapter of that particular CEC.
- Provision should be present to Lock all resources under current resource level with
  identical type.
  Example:
  - This requirement would be used to acquire lock on all partitions under the CEC.

## Design Points Considered

- It is to be noted that the Sessions X-auth-token will be used to uniquely
  identify the HMC Sessions.
- It should also be noted that the HMC-ID and Session-ID are directly obtained
  by the Session header.
- Any session which is expired due to time out, would result in removing those
  session's lock entries from the lock table.

## Proposed Interface Design

The below mentioned design states the proposed rest Interface for the HMC lock
Management.The lock management consists of 3 API's.

- AcquireLock
- ReleaseLock
- GetLockStatus

## AcquireLock

This Interface would facilitate the REST client to send a request to lock a particular
resource of its interest.

### Curl API

```bash
curl -c cjar -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": [LockType:"write",Segmentflags["lockFlags":Dontlock,"Segmentlength":"1"....],ResourceID:"String",..] }' http:/{BMC_IP}/xyz/openbmc_project/HMC/locks/Acquirelock
```

The following are the proposed inputs for the _AcquireLock_ interface.

1. LockType  - String - [read/write]
2. Segmentflags - List of Lockflags,Segmentlength(String)
3. ResourceID - String

### LockType

- The LockType states if the current lock is a Read lock or a Write Lock.

### Segmentflags

- The Segment falgs are used to contruct a multi level lock structure.
- Any valid Segmentflag structure contains 2 to 6 Valid segments.And each segment
  contains Lockflags and Segmentlength and each segment represents the
  corresponding level information.
- LockFlags can be any of the three types as mentioned below :
      - *Dontlock* (Do not lock all resources under current resource level)
      - *Lockall* (Lock all resources under current resource level)
        Example :
          - This flag is used to acquire the lock on all the children under a parent resource
          - Lock all the children under CEC, which implicitly locks the processor, memory,
            partitions and the pysical I/O adapter of that particular CEC.
      - *LockSameSegment* (Lock all resources under current resource level with same segment length)
          - This requirement is used to acquire the lock on all the children of same kind under a
            parent resource.
          - From the above figure, this flag would be used to acquire lock on all partitions under the CEC.
  
Example : [Segmentflags["lockFlags"]:Dontlock,Segmentflags["Segmentlength"]:"1"....]

### ResourceID

- Unique resource identifier managed by HMC. BMC uses the resource ID to perform
  lock comparisons, however it doesnâ€™t care what the actual data means.

#### Returns: Success

- Status - [SUCCESS]:
- Returns - [RequestID:"SampleRequestID",..]

The Curl api for acquiring the lock return the Status as SUCCESS followed by a
list of request ID's, if the request is legitimate as per the design.

#### Returns: Failure

The Curl api for acquiring the lock return the Status as Failure, and also
returns the list of locks that are failed , with the corresponding HMCID,
LockType and the ResourceID.

- [HMCID:"SampleString",LockType:"write",ResourceID:"String",..]
- Status - [FAILURE]

## Release Lock

This interface facilitates the REST client to send a request to release the lock
which was previously obtained by it.

### CurlAPI

```bash
curl -c cjar -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": [[RequestID,..]/All"] }' http:/{BMC_IP}/xyz/openbmc_project/HMC/locks/ReleaseLock
```

The following are the proposed inputs for the _ReleaseLock_ interface.

1.RequestID - String

Example :[request id1,...]

The above command allows the HMC to free locks it previously obtained. If the
requesting HMC does not own all the locks in the request, the entire transaction
will fail and NO locks will be freed. HMC can issue unlocks in one of two ways.
It can can either unlock all owned locks of the perticular established session,
or it can can unlock specific subset of locks(which is a list of HMCID,RequestID)
that are owned by it.

#### Returns

- ResourceID - [HMCID:"SampleString",LockType:"write",ResourceID:"String",..]

BMC would return all the lock contents that cannot be released.The respective
lock contents like the HMCID,LockType and ResourceID are returned.

- Status - [SUCCESS/FAILED]

The Status can be SUCCESS or FAILED.

## GetLockList

This interface would facilitate the REST client(HMC) to query all the locks that
are owned by a particular session.

### Curl API

```bash
curl -c cjar -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": [HMCID:"String/All"],..}' http:/{BMC_IP}/xyz/openbmc_project/HMC/locks/GetLockList
```

The following are the proposed inputs for the _GetLockList_ interface.

1. SessionID - String - [List of SessionID's]

The above command , takes the SessionID as input and returns the list of locks which
are obtained by that particular session.

To obtain the locks owned by a particular session, the HMC would first query for the
list of sessionsID's via GET request on the Session service schema, and then send the
sessionID/(List of SessionID's) as an input to the _GetLockList_ interface.

#### SessionID

- SessionID is a unique string which is generated by the webserver when ever a new
  session is established by the client.

- At anytime the session id can be obtained by traversing the Sessionservice/Session
  schema under Redfish.

Ex:

```bash
$ curl -k -H "X-Auth-Token: $bmc_token" -X GET https://${BMC_IP}/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/KgPKuBnmNI
{
  "@odata.context": "/redfish/v1/$metadata#Session.Session",
  "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/KgPKuBnmNI",
  "@odata.type": "#Session.v1_0_2.Session",
  "Description": "Manager User Session",
  "Id": "KgPKuBnmNI",
  "Name": "User Session",
  "UserName": "root"
```

#### Response

- Returns - [SessionID:"SampleString",LockType:"write",ResourceID:"String",..]
- Status - [SUCCESS/FAILED]

The Status can be SUCCESS or FAILED.

## Alternatives Considered

1. A procedure in which we maintain a one-to-one mapping between the HMC
   recources ID's in BMC , which would help reduce the complexity in conflict
   resolvement in lock managemnt. But the problem would that every time HMC
   add's a new lock, the BMC code also needs to be updated which does not seem
   to be finer solution to the give problem.
2. Another thought point was that, BMC could read the MRW to get the knowledge
   of hardware resources and can lock them based on the corresponding HMC
   request, But the problem with this approach is that, the BMC is un aware of
   the Virtual/Logical resources like parttitions.

## Implementation of HMC Lock

1. Implement the lock API's inside *bmcweb*(include/openbmc_dbus_rest.hpp)
   repository and write a custom route(s) for handling the lock management.

```

2. Implement custom routes for lock management in *bmcweb*, where the custom
   routes would merely call the respective dbus-methods defined for lock(s).The
   actual implementation for these API's would be maintained in a separate repo.
   This hmc features can be enabled/disabled using the distro enbale/disable
   feature while bitbaking the flash image.

3. Define a new OEM schema for HMC management, and use the redfish model to implement
   the proposed HMC rest API's.This change will go inside bmcweb , and the HMC features
   can be disabled/enabled using a custom flag setting during bmcweb compilation.

## Alternative Design Proposal

### Acquire Lock Interface

This Interface would facilitate the REST client to send a request to lock a particular
resource of its interest.

1. LockType  - String - [read/write]
2. ResourcePath - String(separated with '/' to include the parent/child relationship)

#### LockType

- The LockType states if the current lock is a Read lock or a Write Lock.

#### ResourcePath

This is an alternative design where, the HMC would construct a string in the form
of a PATH which would indicate the parent/child relationship for acquiring the lock.
The BMC will not have any understanding on the contents in the Lock String, but
it merely parses the string to form a tree structure so that it could find the
conflicts against the new lock request.

Example:

- Request json structure for locking all the Children under a specific Partition
  which is Under CEC.

```bash
  {
     HMCID:"0x0000xxx"
     ResourcePath: "CEC-<ID/value>/Partition-<ID/value>"  
     LockType:"read"
  }
```

#### Curl API

```bash
curl -c cjar -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data":[LockType:"write",ResourcePath:"Sample/resource/path",..] }' 
http:/{BMC_IP}/xyz/openbmc_project/HMC/locks/Acquirelock
```

#### Returns: Success

- Status - [SUCCESS]

The Curl api for acquiring the lock return the Status as SUCCESS

#### Returns: Failure

The Curl api for acquiring the lock return the Status as Failure, and also
returns the list of locks that are failed , with the corresponding HMCID,
LockType and the ResourceID.

- [SessionID:"SampleString",LockType:"write",ResourcePath:"String",..]
- Status - [FAILURE]

### Release Lock

This interface facilitates the REST client to send a request to release
the lock which was previously obtained by it.

The following are the proposed inputs for the _ReleaseLock_ interface.

1. ResourcePath - String

### CurlAPI

```bash
curl -c cjar -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": [[ResourcePath:"String"],...] }' http:/{BMC_IP}/xyz/openbmc_project/HMC/locks/ReleaseLock
```

The above command allows the HMC to free locks it previously obtained. If the
requesting HMC does not own all the locks in the request, the entire transaction
will fail and NO locks will be freed. HMC can issue unlocks in one of two ways.
It can can either unlock all owned locks of the particular established session,
or it can can unlock specific subset of locks(which is a list of HMCID,RequestID)
that are owned by it.

#### Returns

- [SessionID:"SampleString",LockType:"write",ResourcePath:"String",..]

BMC would return all the lock contents that cannot be released.The respective
lock contents like the SessionID,LockType and ResourcePath are returned.

- Status - [SUCCESS/FAILED]

The Status can be SUCCESS or FAILED.

### GetLockList

This interface would facilitate the REST client(HMC) to query all the locks that are
owned by a particular session.

To obtain the locks owned by a particular session, the HMC would first query for the
list of sessionsID's via GET request on the Session service schema, and then send the
sessionID/(List of SessionID's) as an input to the _GetLockList_ interface.

The following are the proposed inputs for the _GetLockList_ interface.

1. SessionID - String - [List of SessionID's]

#### SessionID

- SessionID is a unique string which is generated by the webserver when ever a new
  session is established by the client.

- At anytime the session id can be obtained by traversing the Sessionservice/Session
  schema under Redfish.

Ex:

```bash
$ curl -k -H "X-Auth-Token: $bmc_token" -X GET https://${BMC_IP}/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/KgPKuBnmNI
{
  "@odata.context": "/redfish/v1/$metadata#Session.Session",
  "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/KgPKuBnmNI",
  "@odata.type": "#Session.v1_0_2.Session",
  "Description": "Manager User Session",
  "Id": "KgPKuBnmNI",
  "Name": "User Session",
  "UserName": "root"
```

#### Curl API

```bash
curl -c cjar -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": [SessionID:"String"],..}' http:/{BMC_IP}/xyz/openbmc_project/HMC/locks/GetLockStatus
```

The above command , takes the SessionID as input and returns the list of locks for
that particular session.

#### Response

- Returns - [SessionID:"SampleString",LockType:"write",ResourceID:"String",..]
- Status - [SUCCESS/FAILED]

The Status can be SUCCESS or FAILED.

### Sample Lock Table Structure (Alternate design)

The following figure dipicts how the BMC stores the lock records.

- It should also be noted that the HMC-ID and Session-ID are directly obtained
  by the Session header.
- Any session which is expired due to time out, would result in removing those
  session's lock entries from the lock table.

## Impacts

Development would be required to implement the lock management interface API's.
Low level design is required to implement the lock management data structure and
Such lowlevel implementation details are not included in this proposal.

## Testing

Testing can be done using simple gtest based unit tests for acquiring lock, releasing
the lock and the getlock status API's.

Thorough testing should be done using multiple HMC's to see if we can hit any
performance issues.

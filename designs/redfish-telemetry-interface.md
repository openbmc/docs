## Problem Description

Current sensor reading interfaces and event logs do not provide sufficient
mechanisms and interfaces to assemble metric reports on intervals or after
some triggering event occurs.

A configurable BMC Telemetry and Health Monitoring Framework for OpenBMC
has been propossed that would include:

* A mechanism to collect the desired metrics data (e.g. collectd)
* A interface to remotely access the metrics data, using both a push and pull
   model, and leveraging any industry standards that exist

This document addresses the second part:

* Defining an industry-standard interface (based on Redfish) to access 
  Telemetry data collected by various backend collectors


## Background and References

Since OpenBMC is moving to [Redfish][RForg] as its standard for out-of-band
management, the proposal is to use the Redfish Telemetry interfaces for
remotely accessing Telemetry data.

The DMTF Redfish forum added support for Telemetry as part of the
***2018.2 Redfish Release Bundle*** that was released in Sept 2018.
( *see the news release:* [New Redfish Release Adds ... Telemetry][PR]).

Note that the Redfish forum had previously released a *work-in-progress*
[Redfish Telemetry Whitepaper][WP] in Jan 2018.  This White Paper has not been
updated to align with *all* changes in the official release and does have some
discrepencies from the release;  however, it is generally correct in describing
the overall Redfish Telemetry model.

The Redfish Telemetry model supports the following features:

* Metric Reports can be delivered with either a *push* or *pull* model

* Metric Reports can be generated on pre-defined *intervals* or as the result
  of a *trigger* event (e.g. a sensor crossing a threshold or something else
  happening)

* The model is *very extensible* and allows OEM-defined Metric Reports that
  may contain:
  - OEM-defined metric properties,
  - OEM-defined triggers that cause a metric report to be generated,
  - OEM-defined filter algorithms that operate on other properties
    (a filter being an algorithm such as *average*, *max*, *min*)
    - More complex filters may be defined as OEM filters by setting the filter
      enum to "OEM" and then adding the description of the filter in the OEM
      section of the Metric property Definition

* In fact, Redfish does not actually pre-define any specific Metric Reports
  or Metric properties in the specification or schemas.  It only defines:

  - The transport mechanisms used to deliver the Metric Reports

  - Schema that defines Metric Properties, Metric Report Definitions,
    Metric Reports, and Metric Triggers that are implemented by the service

  - Standard *formats* for describing time intervals and common triggers
    such as when a sensor crosses thresholds

  - The format of metric reports -- a Redfish-like JSON Schema payload.
    - Note that metric data collected by collectd will have to be converted
      from collectd rdd format to Redfish JSON MetricReport format.
    - collectd has "write plugins" that can store data in rrd format,
      cvs format, or can send to redis, MongoDB, web service using http
      in a putval data format
    - A RedfishTelemetryService daemon will need to process metric reports
      as they are generated by the backend, format the reports, and then
      log or push the reports based on the Redfish Telemetry configuration

  - A few common *filter algorithms* that are pre-defined (average, minimum,
    and maximum) that can be used to define a "Metric Property" based on other
    properties already in the Redfish resource model
    - Example: describing the MetricProperty MaximumInletTemp as the max value
      of the inlet temperature over 24 hours.

  - Note that it is reasonable and expected that a common BMC framework 
    implementation (eg OpenBMC) would implement some common Metric Reports as
    part of the framework and supported by all vendors using OpenBMC.

  - Note that Redfish does not absolutely REQUIRE that an implementation
    include MetricDefinitions; however is is recommended as a best practice
    so OpenBMC should indeed implement Metric Definitions for any metric
    properties returned in a metric report
    - Metric Definitions are informational for a client to better understand
      the metric data returned in a Metric Report
    - The Metric Report and MetricReportDefinition identify the corresponding 
      Metric property from the MetricDefinitions collection with the
      MetricId property.

* The model *supports* the case where a client could *create* a Metric Report
  Definition by POSTing the new *MetricReportDefinition* to the
  *MetricDefinitions Collection*.
  - In this case any Metric Properties and Triggers included in the new
    Metric Report would need to already be supported by properties in the
    Redfish resource model in order for the 

  - Because of implementation complexity in implementing client-defined Metric
    Report definitions, initial implementations are expected to only support
    some set of pre-defined Metric Reports created by the platform vendor
    (based on customer feedback) that clients choose from and subscribe to.
    Each vendor is defining their own.

The Redfish Telemetry model supports three ways to get metric reports:
* *HTTP Push*,
* *SSE Push*, and
* *HTTP Pull*

The MetricReportDefinition resource for each metric report supported by the
system specifies:

* whether the metric report is enabled

* whether to log the metric for a client to pull, vs whether to push the
  metric to clients that have subscribed for this metric report (or have
  been pre-subscribed by configuration)

* if logging is enabled for the metric report, whether to append the new
  metric data to the MetricReport log resource or overwrite the current
  entry with the new entry

* the max number of entries in the MetricReport log resource and whether to
  wrap or stop logging when full

For the ***HTTP Push*** model:

* The BMC must be configured with the IP Address and credentials of a
  remote *metric report catcher service* which is effectively a subscription
  to send metrics to that catcher client

* When the Metric Report is generated (based on interval timer or other
  trigger), the BMC formats the report and pushes it to a remote catcher
  service using HTTPS POST to send the JSON formated Metric Report to the
  report catcher.
  - So an HTTP session is created with the metric catcher, the report is sent,
    and then the session is closed

* With this model, the catcher destination configuration is persistent across
  BMC resets or if the remote client catcher goes offline temporarily

For the ***SSE Push*** (Server-Sent Events) model:

* The SSE model is similar to how Redfish supports pushing other events
  (e.g. SEL events) with SSE
  - Note that this interface uses Server-Sent-Events, not websockets
  - SSE connections are one-way and allow a service to push data to a client
    once the connection is established (vs two-way websocket connection)
  - SSE is HTTP only (vs websocket supporting binary or any protocol)
  - see [SSE vs websockets][SSEvswebsocket]

* A client must create the SSE connection by sending a GET to a
  ServerSentEventUri with various URI query parameters to indicate that the
  connection is a Metric Report SSE connection vs a normal Event Message
  Stream, as well as which events or metric reports the client wants.

* The service then keeps the connection open until the client closes it,
  and Pushes the designated Metric Reports out the SSC connection to the
  client as they are generated.

* With this model, the client must initiate the SSE Push connection,
  and the connections closes when the connection is dropped for any reason
  including BMC reset or client closing the SSE connection


For the ***HTTP Pull*** model:

* The Metric Report Definition that defines the metric report must specify
  that the metric reports should be logged in the MetricReports collection.

* When a new Metric Report is generated the new metric data is added under
  the MetricReports collection.  Either a new resource is added to the
  collection (named by timestamp and report), or the data is appended to
  an array inside a single resource for the report type and configuration
  tells the model whether to wrap after a max number of entries.

* For the 2nd case (a single resource for each report type), a client can
  read the entire array of saved samples with a single HTTP GET of the
  MetricReport for a particular metric type.


The current versions of the Schema files used to model the Telemetry service
are listed below.  The latest Schema versions in CSDL-XML, JSON-Schema, as
well as YAML can be accessed from the [Redfish Schema Folder URI][RfSchemas]
at `https://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/`:

* ***[TelemetryService][TS]*** -- the base/root Telemetry resource that
  contains links to the MetricReportDefinitions collection, MetricDefinitions
  collection, Triggers collection, and MetricReports collection.
  The Redfish ServiceRoot at `/redfish/v1/` has a link to this resource.

* ***[MetricReportDefinitionCollection][MRDC]*** -- collection of all
  MetricReportDefinitions that are supported by the service and that a
  client can subscribe to

* ***[MetricReportDefinition][MRD]*** -- describes a specific MetricReport
  by identifying the Metric Properties included, Triggers that create the
  report, and whether the report is logged in the MetricReportCollection for
  a client to retrieve later
  - An Example GET MetricReportDefinition ***Response*** is shown below

* ***[MetricDefinitionCollection][MDC]*** -- a collection of all Metric
  [Property] Definitions.

* ***[MetricDefinition][MD]*** -- describes a single Metric Property that
  can be included in a Metric Report.  Metrics can be existing Redfish
  properties, filtered properties (ex average or max power), or can be
  OEM defined
  - An Example GET MetricReportDefinition ***Response*** is shown below

* ***[TriggersCollection][TC]*** -- a collection of all Metric Trigger
  Definitions.

* ***[Triggers][TRIG]*** -- describes a single Trigger mechanism that causes
  a Metric Report to be generated

* ***[MetricReportCollection][MRC]*** -- a collection of MetricReport
  resources that contain the actual metric reports available for a client
  to *Pull* by executing an HTTP GET on the resource.

* ***[MetricReport][MR]*** -- contians a MetricReport containing timestamp
  and all metric properties that are part of the metric report.
  - An Example GET MetricReport ***Response*** is shown below

#### Example Responses

* Example `GET MetricDefinition Response`
  - for Metric Property: `AverageConsumedWatts`

  - `GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricDefinitions/AverageConsumedWatts`

  - The metric property: `"AverageConsumedWatts"` is created using the
    `Average` filter applied to the Redfish Property `PowerConsumedWatts`
    in Redfish resource `/redfish/v1/Chassis/1/Power#PowerControl/0`
    - the PowerConsumedWatts value is sampled every 2 seconds based on the
      value of SensingInterval, and the current value is stored in the Redfish
      resource model in a property called AverageConsumedWatts
    - the "Average" filter averages the power over the last 1 hour sliding
      interval as specified by the property "CalculationTimeInterval"

```
{
    "@odata.type": "#MetricDefinition.v1_0_2.MetricDefinition",
    "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricDefinitions/AverageConsumedWatts",
    "Id": "AverageConsumedWatts",
    "Name": "Average Consumed Watts Metric Definition",
    "MetricType": "Numeric",
    "Implementation": "Calculated",
    "PhysicalContext": "PowerSupply",
    "MetricDataType": "Decimal",
    "Units": "W",
    "SensingInterval": "PT2S",
    "CalculationAlgorithm": "Average",
    "CalculationTimeInterval": "PT1H",
    "Calculable": "NonSummable",
    "IsLinear": true,
    "CalculationParameters": [
        {
            "SourceMetric": "/redfish/v1/Chassis/1/Power#/PowerControl/0/PowerConsumedWatts",
            "ResultMetric": "/redfish/v1/Chassis/1/Power#/PowerControl/0/PowerMetrics/AverageConsumedWatts",
        }
    ]
}


```
* Another Example of `GET MetricDefinition Response`
  - for Metric Property: `MinimumConsumedWatts`

  - `GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricDefinitions/MinimumConsumedWatts`

  - Note that NO `"MinimumConsumedWatts"` property is actually created
    in the Redfish resource model.  This MetricDefinition is therefore just
    a definition of how to create a synthetic MinimumConsumedWatts value.

  - The `Minimum` filter is applied to the Redfish Property `PowerConsumedWatts`
    in Redfish resource `/redfish/v1/Chassis/1/Power#PowerControl/0`
    - the PowerConsumedWatts value is sampled every 2 seconds based on the
      value of SensingInterval
    - the "minimum" filter catches the minimum over the last 1 hour sliding
      time interval as specified by the property "CalculationTimeInterval"

```
{
    "@odata.type": "#MetricDefinition.v1_0_2.MetricDefinition",
    "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricDefinitions/MinimumConsumedWatts",
    "Id": "MinimumConsumedWatts",
    "Name": "Minimum Consumed Watts Metric Definition",
    "MetricType": "Numeric",
    "Implementation": "Calculated",
    "PhysicalContext": "PowerSupply",
    "MetricDataType": "Decimal",
    "Units": "W",
    "SensingInterval": "PT2S",
    "CalculationAlgorithm": "Minimum",
    "CalculationTimeInterval": "PT1H",
    "Calculable": "NonSummable",
    "IsLinear": true,
    "CalculationParameters": [
        {
            "SourceMetric": "/redfish/v1/Chassis/1/Power#/PowerControl/0/PowerConsumedWatts"
        }
    ]
}


```

* Example `GET MetricReportDefinition Response`:

  - `GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReportDefinitions/OBmcPowerMetrics`

  - Defines a Metric Report with the following *Metrics*:
    - MinmumConsumedWatts - the *Minimum* power draw over the last hour 
    - MaximumConsumedWatts - the *Maximum* power draw over the last hour 
    - AverageConsumedWatts - the *Average* power draw over the last hour 

  - Additional detail about these 3 metric properties can be read by reading
    the MetricDefinitions with those same MetricIds from the MetricDefinitions
    collection.   Note that "some" data about these metric properties 
    (calculation interval and source property) could be defined in the
    metricReport.  However, the MetricDefinition has more info so
    (such as sampling interval, units, etc).  So since best practice is to
    always include a MetricDefinition, I did not duplicate any data.
    All we need to add in the ReportDefinition is the MetricId which maps
    to the MetricDefinition with that same Id.

  - the report is generated on a 1 hour schedule and reports the min, max, and
    average power consumption read over that hour period

  - the report is pushed as well as logged
    - each report is appended to the OBmcPowerMetrics log until 256 entries, 
      when it wraps

  - The report can be disabled by Patching property
    `"MetricReportDefinitionEnabled": false`

```

    "@odata.type": "#MetricReportDefinition.v1_2_1.MetricReportDefinition",
    "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReportDefinitions/OBmcPowerMetrics",
    "Id": "OBmcPowerMetrics",
    "Name": "Push and Log Platform Power Metrics: Min, Max, Ave",
    "MetricReportDefinitionType": "Periodic",
    "MetricReportDefinitionEnabled": true,
    "Schedule": {
        "RecurrenceInterval": "PT01H"
    },
    "ReportActions": [
        "RedfishEvent",

    ],

    "AppendLimit": 256,
    "MetricReport": {
        "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReports/OBmcPowerMetricsReport"
    },
    "Metrics": [
        {
            "MetricId": "MinimumConsumedWatts",
        },
        {
            "MetricId": "MaximumConsumedWatts",
        },
        {
            "MetricId": "AverageConsumedWatts",
        }
    ],
    "Links": {
        "Triggers": []
    },
    "Status": {
        "State": "Enabled"
    }
}


```

* Example `GET MetricReport Response`:

  - `GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReports/OBmcPowerMetrics`

  - HTTP Pull response to read the OBmcPowerMetrics MetricDefinition
    defined above, containing the following metric properties: 
    - MinConsumedWatts - the *Minimum* power draw over the interval
    - MaxConsumedWatts - the *Maximum* power draw over the interval
    - AveConsumedWatts - the *Average* power draw over the interval

  - Note that the MetricReportDefinition property points to the
    MetricDefinition that defined this report,

  - And the MetricId for each of the MetricValues entries maps to the
    Id of the MetricDefinition for that property

  - Since the MetricDefinition said to both Log and Push this metric report:
    - It is logged in the MetricReports collection under id OBmcPowerMetrics
    - It is pushed to any clients that have subscribed to getting this metric
      report (either via HTTP Push or SSE Push)

```

    "@odata.type": "#MetricReport.v1_2_o.MetricReport",
    "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReports/OBmcPowerMetrics",
    "Id": "OBmcPowerMetrics",
    "Name": "Metric Report: Push and Log Platform Power Metrics: Min, Max, Ave",
    "ReportSequence": "23",
    "MetricReportDefinition": {
        "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReportDefinitions/OBmcPowerMetrics"
    },
    "MetricValues": [
        {
            "MetricId": "MinConsumedWatts",

            "Timestamp": "2018-11-07T11:25:00-01:00"
        },
        {
            "MetricId": "AveConsumedWatts",

        }
    ],
}


```



## Requirements

The initial implementation of Redfish Telemetry support should include:
* Implement the general Redfish Telemetry model APIs:

  - Include a TelemetryService link in Redfish Service Root GET API

  - GET TelemetryService resource
    - static response with links to other metric collections: 
      MetricDefinitions, MetricReportDefinitions, Triggers, MetricReports

  - GET MetricDefinitions collection resource
    - returns a list of links to all of the pre-defined metric properties
      that are included in all metric reports

  - GET MetricDefinition resource
    - returns a *specific* pre-defined metric property definition that was
      identified in the above MetricDefinitionsCollection response

  - GET MetricReportDefinitions collection resource
    - returns a list of links to all of the pre-defined metric report
      definitions currently supported

  - GET MetricReportDefinition resource
    - returns a *specific* MetricReportDefinition resource that was
      identified in the above MetricReportDefinitions Collection response

  - PATCH MetricReportDefinition resource
    - update the settable properties in a specific metric report:
      - MetricReportDefinitionEnabled (true, false)
      - Schedule (sets the period if the report is a periodic metric report)
      - other settable properties could be deferred to the second step 
        (see "Second Step" requirements below)

  - GET TriggersCollection resource
    - returns a list of links to pre-defined metric triggers

  - GET Trigger resource
    - return a *specific* pre-defined metric trigger resource that was
      identified in the above TriggersCollection response

  - GET MetricReportsCollection resource
    - returns a list of links to metric reports that have been created

  - GET MetricReport resource
    - returns a *specific* metric report that was identified in the
      MetricReportsCollection response

* Support for HTTP Push and HTTP Pull metric report delivery to clients

* Implementation of two to three well-bounded metric reports that
  rely on existing underlying sensors to calculate the metric results
  (eg average, max, min power over an interval)

  - PeriodicPowerMetrics -- Average, Minimum, and Maximum Power Consumption
    over an interval
  - PeriodicBmcHealthMetrics -- Average, Minimum, Maximum memory usage,
    CPU usage, etc over interval
  - Other TBD

* Integration with telemetry collection backend eg collectd

The second step would include:

* Support for tuning Metric Report Definitions more

  - PATCH MetgricDefinition
    - SensingInterval
    - CalculationTimeInterval

  - PATCH Trigger
    - DiscreteTriggers / Value, DwellTime, Severity
    - NumericThresholds / [Upper/Lower][Critical/Warning] / Reading, DwellTime,
      and ThresholdActivation (oneOf: Increasing, Decreasing, EIther)
    - MetricProperties (list of properties that are in the Redfish model
      that the trigger definition applies to

  - PATCH MetricReportDefinition -- update the settable properties in a 
    specific metric report:
    - MetricReportDefinitionEnabled (true, false)
    - MetricReportDefinitionType (`Periodic, OnChange, OnRequest`)
    - Schedule (if Type above is set to `Periodic`)
    - MetricProperties (list of any properties that are in the Redfish model
      to include in the report)
    - MetricReportHeartbeatInterval
    - SuppressRepeatedMetricValue

* Support the *SSE Push* delivery model

* More complex metric reports

## Proposed Design

* **bmcweb** will need to implement the general Telemetry infrastructure
  listed above under *Requirements*
  - Some of the infrastructure is simply adding some static responses in
    *bmcweb*:

```
  1) in ServiceRoot response (GET /redfish/v1/),
     add TelemetryService property under *Links*:
    ...
    "TelemetryService": { 
        "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/TelemetryService"
    },
    ...

  2) GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService -- returns a static response with links:
    ...
    "MetricDefinitions": {
        "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricDefinitions"
    },
    "MetricReportDefinitions": {
        "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReportDefinitions"
    },
    "MetricReports": {
        "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReports"
    },
    "Triggers": {
        "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/TelemetryService/Triggers"
    },
    ...
```

  - Some of the infrastructure is GET interfaces to mostly pre-defined
    MetricDefinitions, MetricReportDefinitions, and Triggers.
    - JSON config files can be used to describe these pre-defined resources
      - If there is a better way than using Json config files for this,
        I am open to it of course.
    - *bmcweb* can then generate the GET responses based on those config files
    - The config files would be very similar to the two example responses
      (above) for GET on a MetricReportDefinition and MetricDefinition
      (since most of that data is required)
    - Any settable properties in these configurations
      (eg MetricReportDefinitionEnable) may best be modeled as Dbus properties.
    - These config files (that describe a metric report) would need to be
      aligned with the backend collectors that collect the data for the report
      - The config files can also include the Metric Report info regarding
        whether to log or push the metric report, as well as log wrap vs
        overwrite settings.
    - Long-term, if we support POSTing ***new*** metric definitions or metric
      report definitions, the result of the post can be to create the JSON
      config file.  Backend changes (code or collectd plugin config changes)
      would need to be uploaded separately but aligned with the config files
      - this is complicated and probably not in initial releases
      - would require restart of collectd
    - The JSON Config file-driven APIs are shown below
```

      1) GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricDefinitions -- reads a
           MetricDefinitions.json config file with an Id for each Metric,
           and generates the properly formated Redfish Get Collection response

      2) GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReportDefinitions -- reads a
           MetricReportDefinitions.json config file with an Id for each
           MetricReport, and generates the properly formated response

      3) GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/Triggers -- reads a
            MetricTriggers.json config file with an Id for each Trigger,
            and generates the properly formated response

      4) GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricDefinitions/<id> -- reads
            MetricDefinitions.json config file, extracts the information for
            Id: <id>, and returns a properly formated Redfish Get Metric
            response

      5) GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReportDefinitions/<id> -- reads
           MetricReportDefinitions.json config file, extracts the information
           for Id: <id>, and returns a properly formated Redfish Get
           MetricReport response

      6) GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/Triggers/<id> -- reads
           MetricTriggers.json config file, extracts the information for
           Id: <id>, and returns a properly formated Redfish Get Metric
           Trigger response
```
    - `PATCH to MetricReportDefinitions/<id>` will need to be supported to
       update a few properties:
      - EnableMetricReport
      - maybe interval if it is configured as an interval report

  - *bmcweb* must also implement Redfish APIs to GET any metric reports that
    were *logged* into the Redfish MetricReports collection.

    - Note that for Redfish, the MetricReportDefinition has properties that
      says whether to ***log*** a new report, or whether to ***push*** the
      report, or **both**.

    - In addition, if the report is to be logged, there are also several
      Redfish-specific requirements for handling:
      - wrapping and overwriting of reports in the log, and
      - whether multiple reports of the same MetricReportDefinition
        (ie same report type) are read as a single GET request with an array
        of timestamped entries, or as multiple individual report resources in
        the MetricReports collection requiring multiple GETs

    - Since reports could be pushed or logged or both, and since the way the
      data is saved in the log (replace vs wrap, etc) must be Redfish-aligned,
      I would propose that any time the backend generates a new metric report,
      that it should use an internal Redfish *handleRedfishMetricReport* API
      (described in *below major bullet section* ) that would handle
      converting the data to Redfish format and pushing as well as the
      logging into a Redfish metricReports log

    - If some handleRedfishMetricReport indeed logs the reports that need to
      be logged, then *bmcweb* will need to access the logged metricReports
      for the APIs below that a client can use to *Pull* metric reports:

```
      1) GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReports -- reads the
           MetricReports database (TBD), identifies all of the existing
           MetricReports, and generates a properly formatted Redfish Get
           MetricReports Collection response

      2) GET /redfish/v1/TelemetryService/MetricReports/<id> -- reads the
           MetricReports database (TBD), extracts the data for the report
           associated with <id>, and generates a properly formatted Redfish
           Get MetricReport response

```

* **handleRedfishMetricReport** Design
  - A RedfishTelemetryService service will need to process metric reports
    as they are generated by the backend, format the reports, and then
    log or push the reports based on the Redfish Telemetry configuration

  - When the telemetry backend generates a new report, it would call the
    *handleRedfishMetricReport* API to handle pushing the report and/or
     logging the report in the proper Redfish way

  - If configured to log, the library will need to log the new report data
    based on configuration details that were specified in the
    MetricReportDefinition which includes:
      - Append the report to the single log for this MetricReportDefinition.
        - with wrap after N entries
        - with stop after N entries
      - Over-write the report data in the single log for this
        MetricReportDefinition with new report
      - Create a separate MetricReport resource for each new report generated
        with the Id being the MetricReportDefinition and timestamp

  - Details of how the metric log stores the data need to be discussed
    including:
    - Whether they should or could be non-volatile or volatile (stored in RAM)
    - How much space can be allocated, and thus what the log format needs to be
    - Whether a separate process will need to catch the calls and handle the
      processing since pushing a report could involve retries.
      If OpenBMC has implemented *http Push* events for normal events
      (not metrics), the much of this has already been solved.
    - What the interface that the backend uses to send the data to be
      logged or pushed

* Finally, the Redfish EventService will need minor modifications to support
  *Push MetricReport* subscriptions in addition to standard Redfish event
  subscriptions.


- Other Questions for Discussion:

  - How many independent metric collection ***schedules*** to support

    - Supporting multiple schedules could be a phase-3/4 task

  - Do we want to design for supporting:

    - Client-defined Metric *Property* Definitions that map directly to
      Redfish properties

    - Client-defined Metric *Report* Definitions that are composed of a set
      of any of these Metric Properties and Redfish properties

    - Client-defined sensor threshold triggers

  - Heavy support for client-defined reports is all much more complex to
    implement and test, and likely to fall short of need without OEM-specific
    backend code.

  - It may be more pratical to just make it easy to define the JSON config
    files that pre-define metric propertis and reports and upload those along
    with the corresponding backend plugin code.


## Alternatives Considered
The main alternative to using the Redfish Telemetry model to externally access
and manage metric reports is to use one of the existing collectd interfaces
such as `Write HTTP` to push the metrics directly out to the desired client

* In this case, all of the configurationa and enablement would be via
  collectd native conf files and plugins
* It appears that both PUTVAL and JSON format can be output.
* See [Write_HTTP Plugin example][WritePlugin] for example output. Data saved
  on the bmc could be saved in a file and accessed by file transfer protocols.
* The big downside of this is that more data would need to be transferred
  since there are no provisions for wrapping or over-writing entries


## Impacts
* Additional Redfish APIs must be added to the bmcweb Redfish service

* A new backend telemetry service must be implemented to generate telemetry
  data which is described in another the collectd Telemetry design doc.

* As new MetricDefinitions and MetricReports are added, this will require:
  - Additional backend plugins or code
  - New corresponding Metric property and report definition config files


## Testing
Additional test suites will need to be added to verify the overall Redfish
Telemetry model consistency and that the base Metric Reports are property
formated.  
* We should create a test metric report that can be used to test much of
  the underlying infrastructure.

* We should implement some example metrics based on data that is already
  in the Redfish resource model so that the logging, access APIs, definitions,
  and PUSH mechanisms are independent of a separate collecd backend.

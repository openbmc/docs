## Problem Description
Proposal to provide a mechanism to convert the failure data captured as part
of power Hardware Abstraction Layer(pHAL) library calls to
[Platform Event Log][1] (PEL) format.

## Background and References
OpenBmc Applications use the pHAL layer for hardware access and hardware
initialization, any software/hardware error returned by the pHAL layer need
to be converted to PEL format for logging the error entry. PEL helps to
improve the firmware and platform serviceability during product development,
manufacturing and in customer environment.

Error data includes register data, targets to [guard][2] and callout.
Guard refers to the action of "guarding" faulty hardware from impacting
future system operation. Callout points to a specific hardware with in the
server that relates to the identified error.

[Phosphor-logging][3] [Create][4] interface is used for creating PELs.

pHAL layer constitutes below libraries and and these libraries return
different return codes.
1. libipl used for initial program load
2. libfdt for device tree access
3. libekb for hardware procedure execution
4. libpdbg for hardware access

Proposal is to structure the return data to a standard return code format so
that the caller can just handle the single return code format for conversion
to PEL.

### Glossary
pHAL: power Hardware Abstraction Layer. pHAL is group of libraries running
in BMC. These libraries are used by Open Power specific application for
hardware complex interactions, hostboot and Self Boot Engine initialization,
diagnostics and debugging.

libfdt: pHAL uses to construct the in-memory tree structure of all targets.
[Reference][5]

libpdbg: library to allow debugging of the host POWER processors from the BMC
[Reference][6]

MRW: Machine readable workbook. An XML description of a machine as specified
by the system owner.

HWP: Hardware procedure. A "black box" code module supplied by the hardware
team that initializes host processor and memory subsystems in a platform
-independent fashion.

Device Tree: A device tree is a data structure describing the hardware
components of a particular computer so that the operating system's kernel can
use and manage those components, including the CPU or CPUs, the memory, the
buses and the peripherals. [Reference][7]

EKB: EKB library contains all the hardware procedures (HWP) for the specific
platform and corresponding error XML files for each hardware procedure.

PEL: [Platform Entity Log][1]

## Requirement
### libekb
EKB library contains hardware procedures for the specific platform and the
corresponding error xml files for each hardware procedure. Error XML specifies
attribute data, targets to callout, targets to guard, and targets to
deconfigure for a specific error. Parsers in EKB library parse the error XML
file and generate a c++ header file which is used by the hardware procedure
in capturing the failure data.

Add parser in libekb to parse the error XML file and provide methods that can
parse the failure data returned by the hardware procedure methods and return
data in key, value pairs so that the same can be used in the creation of PEL.

### libipl
Initial program load library used for booting the system. Library internally
calls hardware procedures (HWP) of EKB library. Hardware procedure execution
status need to be returned to the caller so that caller can create PEL on
hardware procedure execution failure.

### libpdbg
libpdbg library is used for hardware access, any hardware access errors need
to be captured as part of the PEL.


### Message Registry Entries
For errors to be raised in pHal corresponding error message registry entries
need to be created in the [message registry][8].

## Proposed design
### Hardware procedure failure
Add parser in libekb to parse the error XML file and provide methods that can
parse the failure data returned by the hardware procedure methods and return
data in key, value pairs so that the same can be used in the [Create][4]
interface for the creation of PEL.

Inventory strings for the targets to Callout/Guard/Deconfig need to be added
to the additional data section of the Create interface.

Applications need to register callback methods in libekb library to get back the
error logging traces.

Debug traces returned through the callback method will be added to the PEL.


### libipl internal failure
Applications need to register callback methods in libipl library to get back the
error logging traces.

Debug traces returned through the callback method will be added to the PEL.

### libpdbg internal failure
Applications need to register callback methods to get the debug traces from
libpdbg library.

Debug traces returned through the callback method will be added to the PEL.

### Process boot failures

## Alternatives Considered
None

## Impacts
None

## Future changes
At present using [Create][4] by providing the data in std::map format the same
will be changed to JSON format when the corresponding support to pass JSON files
to the Create interface is added.

## Testing
1. Simulate hardware procedure failure and check if PEL is created.

## Problem Description
NIC core-dump is essential for NIC issue debugging, and it could be retrieved via both in-band and out-band method. The design here is providing the solution for NIC out of band dumping from BMC over NC-SI protocol.

## Background and References
NC-SI command for dump retrieval:
Reference: NC-SI spec v1.2: section: 8.4.114
https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0222_1.2.0.pdf
	
## Requirements
This feature requires Linux kernel to support transferring new NC-SI command (0x4D) in net/ncsi module
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master/net/ncsi
	
## Proposed Design
This design will reuse existing phosphor-debug-collector module: https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-debug-collector
User could call CreateDump Dbus-method with new NC-SI dump type under 
"xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.Manager /xyz/openbmc_project/dump/bmc xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.Create" for dump creation
			
A new dreport plugin named "ncsidump" will be added for dump file generation.
And this plugin will use ncsi-netlink utility to create the dump file and put it into dump folder for pakage preparation.
	
All NC-SI dump procedure will be implemented in ncsi-netlink:
https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-networkd/blob/master/src/ncsi_netlink_main.cpp
	
The following block diagram illustrate entire dump procedure and relationship between modules:

## Alternatives Considered
We shall block duplicated dump procedure by the reception ordering of NC-SI command(0x4d) shall be maintained.
## Impacts
None.
## Testing
Co-work with NIC vendor(Broadcom) for dump process/file validation.

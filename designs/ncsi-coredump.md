## Problem Description

NIC core-dump is essential for NIC issue debugging, and it could be retrieved
via both in-band and out of band method. The design here is providing the
solution for NIC out of band dumping from BMC over NC-SI protocol.

## Background and References

NC-SI command for dump retrieval: Reference: NC-SI spec v1.2: section: 8.4.114
<https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0222_1.2.0.pdf>

NC-SI over MCTP:
<https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0261_1.3.0.pdf>

## Requirements

This feature requires Linux kernel to support transferring new NC-SI command
(0x4D) in net/ncsi module
<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master/net/ncsi>

## Proposed Design

### Interface

This design will reuse existing phosphor-debug-collector module:
<https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-debug-collector> and extend the dump
creation interface with a new "NC-SICoreDump" dump type.

The D-Bus interface for dump creation will be:"xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.Manager
/xyz/openbmc_project/dump/bmc xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.Create"

To indicate which NC-SI link to target, The CreateDump method need one
additional input parameter: "NICTarget". An EID or network interface, such as
eth0 could be a valid value.

### Dump Retrieval

Using standard NC-SI command: Retrieve Data From NC(0x4D) to get the dumps by
NC-SI over RBT or NC-SI over MCTP protocol. All NC-SI dump procedure will be
implemented in ncsi-netlink and ncsi-mctp utility in phosphor-networkd:
<https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-networkd/blob/master/src/ncsi_netlink_main.cpp>

### Integrate with phosphor-debug-collector

Since phosphor-debug-collector using shell scripts for data collection, a new
collector script named "ncsicoredump" will be added. This script will help to
call ncsi-netlink or ncsi-mctp by different NICTarget and generate dump file
under specific folder.

The following block diagram illustrate entire dump procedure and relationship
between modules:

### Redfish Integration for NIC Core Dumps
The NIC core dump functionality now supports interaction through the Redfish API, 
in addition to the existing DBus-based interface. This enhancement allows users 
to trigger and manage NIC core dumps using a standardized Redfish interface, 
making the process more accessible and easier to integrate with broader system 
management tools that utilize Redfish.

When a user sends a Redfish request to create a NIC dump, the Redfish service 
leverages the existing DBus CreateDump method by issuing a corresponding command 
to the xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.Manager service, targeting the 
/xyz/openbmc_project/dump/nic path. The response from the DBus command, which 
includes details such as the dumpâ€™s status and file location, is then formatted 
into a JSON object and returned to the user via the Redfish API.

Example Usage:

Redfish Endpoint:
/redfish/v1/Managers/bmc/LogServices/NICDump/Actions/LogService.CreateDump

Mapped DBus Path:
/xyz/openbmc_project/dump/nic

Triggering a NIC Dump via Redfish:
curl -k -u 'username:password' -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"DumpType": "nic", "Target": "eth0"}' \
https://<bmc-ip>/redfish/v1/Managers/bmc/LogServices/NICDump/Actions/LogService.CreateDump

Example Redfish Response:

{
  "Id": "1",
  "Name": "NIC Dump",
  "Status": "Completed"
  "Path": "/xyz/openbmc_project/dump/nic/entry/1",
  "DumpType": "nic",
  "Target": "eth0",
  "Timestamp": "2024-08-23T10:00:00+00:00",
  "DownloadURL": "https://<bmc-ip>/files/ncsi.log"
}

Downloading the Dump File:

curl -k -u 'username:password' \
https://<bmc-ip>/files/ncsi.log \
--output ncsi_dump.log

Explanation of the Workflow:
1. Redfish Request: The user initiates the creation of a NIC dump by sending a 
POST request to the specified Redfish endpoint. This request is then handled by 
the Redfish service, which triggers the corresponding DBus command.

2. DBus Command Execution: The DBus command creates the dump and returns critical 
details such as the DBus path and the physical file location of the dump. 
The Redfish service retrieves this information and prepares a response for the user.

3. Redfish Response: The Redfish service provides the user with a JSON response 
that includes all necessary information, such as the status of the dump, 
the DBus path, and a direct URL to download the dump file.

4. Downloading the File: The user can then use the provided download URL to retrieve 
the dump file directly from the BMC.

## Alternatives Considered

We shall block duplicated dump procedure by the reception ordering of NC-SI
command(0x4d) shall be maintained. Since the core dump will contain up to 2
crash dump inside, we only support core dump now by it's sufficient for current
usage.

## Impacts

None.

## Testing

Co-work with NIC vendor(Broadcom) for dump process/file validation.

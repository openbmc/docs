## Problem description
Redfish in OpenBMC currently supports sending response to the clients
which requests for data. Currently there is no service to send asynchronous
message to the client about any events, error or state updates.

The goal of this design document is to give resource overview of
redfish event service and its implementation details in OpenBMC.

## Requirements

High level requirements:

  - BMC shall support send asynchronous event notification to external
    subscribed clients over network using redfish(http/https) protocol,
    instead of regular querying mechanism.
  - BMC shall provide mechanism to the users to configure event service
    with specific filters and accordingly send the event notifications
    to all the registered clients.
  - BMC shall preserve the event service configuration across reboots, and
    shall reset the same, when factory defaults applied.
  - BMC shall have provision to disable the EventService.
  - The BMC Redfish interface shall support the EventService, EventDestination
    and EventDestinationCollection schemas.
  - BMC can provide functionality to send out test events(SubmitTestEvent).
  - Must allow only users having 'ConfigureManager' to create, delete or
    updated event service configuration, subscriptions and restrict other users.
    Must allow users with 'Login' privileges to view the EventService
    configuration and subscription details.
  - EventService shall be specific to Redfish Interface alone.
    i.e No other service can add/modify/delete configuration or subscriptions.
  - Either the client or the service can terminate the event stream at any time.
    The service may terminate a subscription if the number of delivery error's
    exceeds preconfigured thresholds.
  - For Push style event subscription creation, BMC shall respond to a
    successful subscription with HTTP status 201 and set the HTTP Location
    header to the address of a new subscription resource. Subscriptions are
    persistent and shall remain across event service restarts.
  - For Push style event subscription creation, BMC shall respond to client with
    http status as
    - 400: If parameter in body is not supported.
    - 404: If request body contains both RegistryPrefixes and MessageIds.
  - SSE: BMC shall respond to GET method on URI specific in "ServerSentEventUri"
    in EventService schema with 201(created) along with subscription
    information. BMC shall open a new https connection and should keep
    connection alive till subscription is valid. BMC shall respond with https
    code 400, if filter parameters are not supported or 404 if filter
    parameter contains invalid data. Also SSE subscription data cannot be
    persistent across service resets/reboots.
  - Clients shall terminate a subscription by sending an DELETE message to
    the URI of the subscription resource.
  - BMC may terminate a subscription by sending a special "subscription
    terminated" event as the last message. Future requests to the associated
    subscription resource will respond with HTTP status code 404.
  - BMC shall accept the "Last-Event-ID" header from the client to allow a
    client to restart the event/metric report stream in case the connection
    is interrupted.
  - To avoid exhausting the connection resource, BMC shall implement a
    restriction of maximum 20 connections (Maximum of 10 SSE connections). BMC
    shall respond with 503 Service Unavailable server error response code
    indicating that the server is not ready to handle the request.
  - BMC shall log an redfish event message for subscription addition, deletion
    and modification.
  - Services shall not send a "push" event payload of size more than 1 MB.

## Proposed design

Redfish event service provides a way to subscribe to specific kinds of Events,
MetricReport and asynchronously send subscribed type of events or reports
to client whenever it occurs.

Two styles of events are supported OpenBMC EventService.

  1. Push style events (https): When the service detects the need to send
     an event, it uses an HTTP POST to push the event message to the client.
     Clients can enable reception of events by creating a subscription entry
     in the EventService.

  2. Server-Sent Events (SSE):  Client opens an SSE connection to the service
     by performing a GET on the URI specified by the "ServerSentEventUri" in
     the Event Service.

This document majorly focuses on OpenBMC implementation point of view. For more
details specific to EventService can be found in ["Redfish Specification"](

This document doesn't cover below component design.

  1. Redfish Event Logs: This is existing implementation. In OpenBMC,
     All events will be logged to Journal control logs and RSyslog service,
     monitors event logs associated with "REDFISH_MESSAGE_ID" and write the
     required information to "/var/log/redfish" for persisting the event logs.

     So EventService design is hooked to Redfish Event Logs majorly for below
     two reasons.

       - Get the notification whenever new event is logged to Redfish event
         Logs.
       - Way to read the Redfish event log information.

     This document covers one example Redfish Event Log implementation covered
     under below design. As part of it, it uses inotify for getting
     notification about new event log and read the log information by accessing
     the redfish event log file.

     Refer below link for more information on same.
[link](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/redfish-logging-in-bmcweb.md)

     If other OEM's has different implementation for Redfish EventLogs, they
     can satisfy  above mentioned two requirement and can hook it to
     EventService design specified here.
     For example, If xyz OEM uses D-Bus based Redfish Event logs, They can
     use 'signal' for notifying the new redfish event log and event log
     information. They can replace 'inotify' with 'signal' and hook their
     OEM specific Redfish event log to this Redfish EventService design.

  2. Telemetry service: Redfish telemetry service is used to gather all the
     metrics reports associated with different resources such as Power metrics,
     thermal metrics, memory metrics, processor metrics etc... Monitoring
     service in telemetry supports different modes along with aggregated
     operations(Single, average, max, min, sum etc..).

     Refer below link for design document of telemetry service.
[link](https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/#/c/openbmc/docs/+/24357/)


### Redfish resource schema's

Redfish will have three major resources to support EventService.

  1. Event Service
  2. Subscription Collections
  3. Subscriptions

All the configuration and subscriptions information data will be cached on
bmcweb webserver and synced with config json file for restoring and persisting
the data.

**EventService**

  Contains the attributes of the service such as Service Enabled, status,
  delivery retry attempts, Event Types, Subscriptions, Actions URI etc.

   - URI : `/redfish/v1/EventService`
   - SCHEMA : [EventService](https://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/EventService_v1.xml)
   - METHODS : `GET, PATCH`

Refer Testing for supported properties and example.

**Subscription Collections**
  This resource is used to get collection of all subscriptions and also used
  to configure the new subscriptions for automatic events.

   - URI : `/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions`
   - SCHEMA : [EventDestinationCollection](https://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/EventDestinationCollection_v1.xml)
   - METHODS : `GET, POST`

Refer Testing section for example.

**Subscriptions**
  This resource contains the subscription details. Used to get each individual
  get subscription information, update & Delete existing subscription
  information.

   - URI : `/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/<ID>`
   - SCHEMA : [EventDestination](https://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/EventDestination_v1.xml)
   - METHODS : `GET, PATCH, DELETE`

Refer Testing section for supported properties and example.


### Event service manager

Event Manager is main block which does monitor the events, format the request
body and send it to the subscribed destinations. It shall support for two types
of event formats which are define in redfish specification.

  1. Event: Resource type 'Event' is used to receive alerts in the form of
     json body to subscribed clients when the subscription details matches
     for those event logs.

  2. MetricReport: It is used to receive alerts in the forms of json body
     to subscribed clients when the subscription details matches for the
     collected telemetry data by telemetry service.

The "Event service sender" is common entity for both type of resources. The
formatter and monitor entities are different for each type of resources.

**Event log monitor**

In OpenBMC, all the redfish event logs are currently logged to persistent area
of BMC filesystem("/var/log/redfish"). The "Event log monitor" service under
"Event service manager" will use **inotify** to watch on redfish event log file
to identify the new events. Once it identifies the new events, it will read
all logged events information from redfish event file and pass it to 'Event
log formatter' for further processing. The last processed event data timestamp
will be cached in bmcweb to identify the new events in redfish event log file.

It monitors the live events for sending asynchronously and does not send
the events logged before bmcweb service start.

**Event log formatter**

It is used to format the request body by reading event logs passed
from 'Event log monitor' and filter the data by reading subscription
information. It will fetch all the subscription information from "Redfish
event service store" and filter the events by checking severity, event
type against the user subscribed information. It formats the http
"request body" along with CustomText, HttpHeaders and send the Events over
network using http protocol for the filtered subscribers.

Refer Tested section for example request body.

**MetricReport monitor**

Telemetry monitoring service ( Not covered in this document) is responsible
for gathering metrics from D-Bus sensors and exposing them as D-Bus objects.
Monitoring service supports different monitoring modes (periodic, on change
and on demand) along with aggregated operations such as single, average, max
min, sum etc... This service periodically collects the metrics report depending
on Telemetry service configuration such as 'Metric Definitions', 'Metric
Report Definitions' and 'Metric Triggers'.

The telemetry monitor shall emit a signal when there is a collection of
report. MetricReport monitor/agent shall implement the listener for
telemetry signal and using the subscription information, it should match,
filter the desired metric report to pass it on to 'MetricReport formatter'.
Since 'MetricReport monitor' is tightly coupled with 'Telemetry monitor' which
already does the monitoring loop, its responsibility of 'Telemetry
monitor' to match the subscriptions rules and provide it to MetricReport
formatter. The EventService should provide a way to communicate the
subscriptions data whenever user creates or updates or delete subscription.

**MetricReport formatter**

The 'MetricReport formatter' is responsible for formatting the data which comes
from 'MetricReport monitor/agent' by checking subscriptions information
such as HttpHeaders, Custom text strings along with Telemetry report data.

**Event service sender**

The "Event service sender" is used to send the formatted request body
which is passed from 'Event log formatter' or 'Telemetry formatter' to
all filtered subscribers. It supports sending both https and http
requests by using beast library. The http/https connections handling
(open/close) differs for both subscription types such as 'Push style
events' and 'SSE' and more detailed are covered in respective sections.

Beast is a C++ header-only library serving as a foundation for writing
interoperable networking libraries by providing low-level HTTP/1, WebSocket,
and networking protocol vocabulary types and algorithms using the consistent
asynchronous model of Boost.Asio.
For more information on beast, refer
[link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/introduction.html)

  1. PUSH style eventing: BMC uses the boost::beast for asynchronously sending
     events to the subscribed clients. Here is the Beast client Examples for
     sending the synchronous and asynchronous requests over encrypted and
     un-encrypted channels.
[link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/beast/example/http/client/async/)
[link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/beast/example/http/client/async-ssl/)

  2. Server-Sent Events (SSE): The EventDestination resource of the
     subscription data shall contains the opaque of opened client
     SSE stream connection. After receiving the formatted event associated
     with specific subscription information, EventSender writes the formatted
     event data on open SSE connection with specific ID so that client
     can receive the event.

In case of push style eventing, https connection will be established
during first event. If the connection is already established with subscription
ID, then it uses same connection handle for sending events. This connection
handle and subscription map will be stored in event service sender. Users can
have multiple subscriptions coming from single destination and BMC will
have separate connection handle associated with each subscription. Event
listeners (web servers) has capability to accept multiple connections from
same client(BMC) and depending on routing rules, the received events will be
parsed on event listener side.

In case of SSE, connection handle will be read from resource and used by
sender for sending events.

Received formatted data will be pushed to queue maintained under sender,
against the connection-subscription map. Upon successful sending
of event data, formatted data entry will be pop-ed from queue and
next formatted data will be attempted for send and so on.

If send event(logs or metric reports) fails, then it will retry for
number of attempts configured in Event Service "DeliveryRetryAttempts" with
an interval of "DeliveryRetryIntervalSeconds". In case of Push Style Events
if send fails due to some reasons, https connection will be
re-established and first send will be re-attempted. If the failure persist even
after the configured retry attempts, subscription information will be deleted
and same will be updated to consumers(Telemetry service or event log service).
In SSE connection, bmcweb would only retry sending events in the case of
network failure/timeout/congestion. If there is error like connreset/badf,
bmcweb will delete the subscription as specified above. In such scenario's,
user can re-subscribe for events. This is requirement as per current redfish
specification.

Any temporary network failure during event notification, and the failure
persist till threshold limit, subscription entry will be remove. This may be
security concern as client may not know about subscription termination,
once network comes back.
Note: Redfish specification says, Event destination subscription should be
terminated after reaching threshold limit. This is known security concern.
TBD: Need to work with Redfish forum for resolution.


### Redfish event service store

Redfish event service store is used to store the all configuration
related to EventService and subscriptions information. This does
below operations:

  - During bmcweb service start, it gets all the configuration and
    subscriptions information from config json file and populates the
    internal structures data.

  - Redfish EventService resources will get/update this event store for any
    user activities via redfish(Like Get/Add/Update/Delete subscriptions etc.)

  - It will sync the "event config store" with configuration Json file for
    persisting the information when there is update.
    __Note__: Configuration json file will be updated only for Push style event
    subscription information. SSE events subscription information
    is volatile and will not get updated to json file.

  - It will be used for getting all the subscription information to the
    "Event service manager" for filtering event data.


The bmcweb service will update the config store data
including EventService configuration and subscription information to the
json file(location: /var/lib/bmcweb/eventservice_data.json).
This will be persistent across the bmcweb service restarts or bmc reboots
and loads this while initializing bmcweb EventService class.

Note:

  1. In case of SSE, Client is initiator of connection and so SSE stream
     connection can't be re-established when bmcweb service or BMC goes
     for reboot. Hence subscription information related to SSE will not
     be persistent and Client must re-subscribe for SSE events using
     "ServerSentEventUri", whenever bmc comes out of reset.

     Limitation: If bmcweb server closes abruptly due to some reasons
     like watchdog trigger, then bmcweb can't send close connection
     event to SSE client(For notifying SSE client to re-establishing
     connection).


Cache implementation includes below major blocks:

  - EventServiceStore Class: It holds the map of all subscriptions with
    unique key and methods to Create/Delete/update subscription
    information. It also holds the high level configuration information
    associated with EventService schema.

  - Configuration structure: It holds the configuration associated with
    EventService schema properties.

  - Subscription structure: It holds the data associated with each
    EventDestination schema properties along with established connection
    handle.


### Server-Sent Events (SSE):

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a browser to
receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection. The Server-Sent
Events EventSource API is standardized as part of HTML5 by the W3C.

Server-Sent Events is a standard describing how servers can initiate data
transmission towards clients once an initial client connection has been
established. They are commonly used to send message updates or continuous
data streams to a browser client and designed to enhance native,
cross-browser streaming through a JavaScript API called EventSource, through
which a client requests a particular URL in order to receive an event stream.

The "EventService" resource contains a property called "ServerSentEventUri".
If a client performs a GET on the URI specified by the "ServerSentEventUri",
the bmcweb server keep the connection open and conform to the HTML5
Specification until the client closes the socket. The bmcweb service
should sent the response to GET URI with following headers.

```
'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
'Connection': 'keep-alive'
```

Events generated by the OpenBMC will be sent to the clients using the open
connection. Response of event message should contain the "data: " prefix and
postfix "\n" on each line. For representing the end of data, it should end
with "\n\n". Example sending json response should look like
```
data: {\n
data: "msg": "hello world",\n
data: "id": 12345\n
data: }\n\n
```

Open connection: When a client performs get on 'ServerSentEventUri' with
desired filters, bmcweb create an EventDestination instance in the
subscriptions collection. Once bmcweb receives the SSE stream request,
the open connection will be upgraded to WebSocket by checking the request
Content-Type header(matches to 'text/event-stream') and keep the connection
alive till the client/server closes the connection. Please refer
[link](https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/#/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/13948/) for
details on how to upgrade the connection for SSE. The "Context" property
in the EventDestination resource shall be an opaque string generated by the
service.

Note: since its GET operation on existing open connection(which is
authenticated and authorized as normal operation), there is no special
security breach with it. All bmcweb related security threat model applies
here.

Close connection: Either the client or the server can terminate the event
stream at any time and close the connection. The bmcweb server can delete the
corresponding EventDestination instance when the connection is closed.

Connection can be closed by,

  - Client by sending DELETE method on subscribed id URI.
  - Server(bmcweb) can close connection and send notification to client
    with 'event: close' request body.

Since SSE is uni-directional, if client closes connection/browser abruptly,
bmcweb service doesn't know the client connection state. This is limitation on
SSE connection. In such scenario bmcweb service may delete a subscription, if
the number of delivery errors exceeds preconfigured thresholds.

Note:
  - The SSE subscription data is not persistent in nature. When bmcweb
    restarts or BMC reboots, client should re-establish the SSE connection to
    bmcweb to listen for events.
  - In case of SSE, client can send the "Last-Event-ID" as header. Monitor
    service will fetch all the event or metric report stream captured after
    that specified "Last-Event-ID" and send to client after formatting. If
    it fails to find the specified event ID, it will start streaming only live
    events/metric reports.

The service should support using the $filter query parameter provided in the
URI for the SSE stream by the client to reduce the amount of data returned
to the client.

Supported filters are:

  - RegistryPrefix
  - ResourceType
  - EventFormatType
  - MessageId
  - OriginResource

Example for subscribing SSE with filters:
```
MessageId based filter:
METHOD: GET
URi: https://<BMCIP>/redfish/v1/EventService/SSE?MessageId='Alert.1.0.LanDisconnect'

RegistryPrefix based filter:
https://sseuri?$filter=(RegistryPrefix eq Resource) or (RegistryPrefix eq
Task)

ResourceType based filter:
https://sseuri?$filter=(ResourceType eq 'Power') or (ResourceType eq
'Thermal')
```

### Push style events (HTTP/HTTPS)

Unlike the SSE (where bmcweb act as server) push style events works in
different way. In this case, BMC acts as HTTP client and send the data
to webserver running on external system. In case of SSE, connection
will be kept alive till stream closes but in push style events, connections
are opened on need and closes immediately after pushing event/report data.

By using POST method on '/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions' URI with
desired request body (mandatory fields: Destination, Protocol), user can
subscribe for the events. The monitor and formatter resources (both Event
log and MetricReport) uses the subscribed data for match rules, when there
is event log or Telemetry data available. The 'Event service sender' uses
the destination field in subscribed data for opening the connection and
pushing data to webserver running externally.

It shall support both http and https (https is not defined in Redfish
specification) connections which will be created using the boost::beast
library. For https connection it uses the self-signed certificates which are
loaded in certificate store. If establishing connection fails, it retries for
configured retry attempts (DeliveryRetryAttempts) and delete the subscription
if it reaches threshold limit. If SSL negotiation fails, it will not retry for
connection establishment. Users can upload new certificates. More details
about certificate can be found at
[link](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/designs/redfish-tls-user-authentication.md)

Example for created Push style event is documented in testing section
of same document.

### SubmitTestEvent
  This action shall add a test event to the event service with the event
  data specified in the action parameters. This message should then be sent
  to any all subscribed Listener destination targets depending on subscription
  data.

   - URI: `/redfish/v1/EventService/Actions/EventService.SubmitTestEvent`
   - SCHEMA: [EventService](https://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/EventService_v1.xml)
   - METHODS : `POST`

Note: EventService.v1_3_0 was updated to deprecate the EventType parameter in
      SubmitTestEvent, and add the EventGroupId parameter in SubmitTestEvent.

Example POST Request body:
```
{
  "Message": "Test Event for validation",
  "MessageArgs": [],
  "EventId": "OpenBMC.0.1.TestEvent",
  "EventGroupId" : "",
  "Severity": "OK"
}
```


## Alternatives considered

**HTTP POLLING**

Polling is a traditional technique where client repeatedly polls a server for
data. The client makes a request and waits for the server to respond with data.
BMC provides a way to pool the event logs (using Events schema). Client can
run continuously http GET on Events LogService and get the all the events from
BMC. But in HTTP protocol fetching data revolves around request/response which
is greater HTTP overhead.

Push style(https) eventing or SSE will avoid the http overhead of continuous
polling and send the data/events when it happens on server side to the
subscribed clients.

**WEBSOCKET**

WebSocket provides a richer protocol to perform bi-directional, full-duplex
communication. Having a two-way channel is more attractive for some case but in
some scenarios data doesn't need to be sent from the client(Client just need
updates from server errors/events when it happens.)

SSE provides uni-directional connection and operates over traditional HTTP. SSE
do not require a special protocol or server implementation to get working.
WebSocket on the other hand, require full-duplex connections and new Web Socket
servers to handle the protocol.

**IPMI PEF**

Platform Event Filtering (PEF) provides a mechanism for configuring the BMC
to take selected actions on event messages that it receives. This mechanism
is IPMI centric which has its own limitation in terms of security, scalability
etc. when compared with Redfish.

##  Implementation design alternatives

  - Direct journal logs vs Redfish event log file using inotify

Considered reading direct journald logs using sd_journal_<xyz> api's but that
seems to be in-efficient because

  1. sdjournal has multiple logs currently( not just event logs) and so this
     become very inefficient to monitor and process data to identify just for
     redfish event logs.

  2. Some hooks need to be added to sdjournal to emit signals whenever messages
    are logged to sdjournal.

To overcome above challenges currently redfish event logs are filtered and
logged to separate file using rsyslog. Same file is used by EventService
by monitor the file using inotify.

  - D-Bus service vs Event Service config store

Considered creating separate D-Bus service for storing EventService
configuration and subscriptions data. Also considered using settings
D-Bus service for persisting the data across the reboots. But since
EventService is specific to redfish/bmcweb and not consumed/updated
by any other processes in system, there is no real gain with having D-Bus
service.

## Impacts

Security issue with Push style events:

Push style events also support HTTP protocol which is not secured and is
susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping which may lead to
virus injections and leak sensitive information to attackers. The push style
event subscription or changes to the BMC will be done over the
secure HTTPS channel with full authentication and authorization. So, BMC side
security is NOT compromised. Event Listener on client may get hacked data
in-case of man-in-the-middle attacks. To avoid such attacks, it is recommended
to use SSE event mechanism or https-based push style events.

SSE works on HTTPS protocol which is encrypted and secured. SSE EventService
subscriptions can be created or updated over HTTPS protocol along with proper
authentication and authorization on BMC users. Please refer security details
(section 13) in DSP0266 for more information.

SSE connections:

When client opens the SSE HTTPS connection, it will be on open state until
client or server closes the connection. On Linux, there is a limit on each file
descriptor(Of course this is very huge number > 8K). Multiple open http
connections on bmcweb can slow down the performance.

Since open SSE client connection is proxied under multiple level of BMC side
protection (like Authentication is required, User should have proper privilege
level to establish the SSE connection etc.), these impacts are mitigated. Also
BMC will have support for maximum of 10 SSE subscriptions which will limit the
number of http connections exhaust scenario. This can be compile time option.

## Testing

User should cover below functionalists.

 - View and update EventService configuration using GET and PATCH methods and
   validate the functionality.
 - Subscribe for Events (Both "Push style event" and "SSE") as described below
   and validate http status code for positive and negative use cases (Body
   parameter invalid, Invalid request, improper privilege - forbidden etc.).
 - Validate all subscription collections and each individual subscription.
 - Using delete method on subscription URI specific to ID and see connection
   closing properly on client side and subscription data clear on server side.
 - Enable and disable EventService, generate events and validate whether Events
   are sending properly to all subscriptions when its enabled and stopped
   sending when disabled.
 - Use SubmitTestEvent for generating Test Events. Also cover negative cases
   with invalid body data.
 - Validate the functionality of retry attempts and retry timeout with both
   positive and negative cases.
 - Client connection close: Close client connection which are listening for SSE
   and check server-side connection closes after configured retry attempts and
   clears the subscription information.
 - Reboot BMC or reset bmcweb service and check all "push style events"
   subscription is preserved and functional by generating and checking events.
 - Reboot BMC or reset bmcweb service and check all "SSE" subscription data
   is not preserved and client-side connection is closed properly.
 - Create user with multiple privileges and check create/delete/update
   subscription and configuration data are performed only for user having
   'ConfiguredManager' privilege and view EventService information works only
   for 'Login'.
 - Create new subscription and check is the event message logged in redfish
   event logs or not. Also modify, delete subscription and see Redfish events
   are logged or not.
 - Validate the authenticity of events sent to client on subscription with
   proper filtered data(Ex: If RegisteryPrefixes is set to "OpenBMC.0.1", it
   should not send events with prefixes "OpenBMC.0.2") should be validated.
 - For security, validate GET on URI specified in "ServerSentEventUri" with
   un-authorized users and see it responds with properly http status code and
   should not create any subscription or open any http connection.
 - Max limit check: Creates max supported event subscriptions and validate.


** Push style events: **

  1) EventListner: Client should configure the web service for listening the
     events (Example: http://192.168.1.2/Events).

  2) Subscription:
     Client can subscribe for events on BMC using below
```
URI: /redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions
METHOD: POST
REQUEST BODY:
{
  "Destination":"http://192.168.1.2/Events",
  "Context":"CustomText",
  "Protocol":"Redfish",
}
```
     On successful event subscription client will receive 201(Created) http
     status code along with created subscription ID. At this point onwards,
     client will receive events associated with subscribed data.

     Client can use "SubmitTestEvent" (Documented above) to test the working
     state.

  3) ViewSubscription: Client can get the subscriptions details using
```
URI: /redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/<ID>
METHOD: GET
```

  4) UpdateSubscription: At any point client can update the subscription
     information.
```
URI: /redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/<ID>
METHOD: PATCH
REQUEST BODY:
{
  "Destination":"http://192.168.1.2/Events",
  "Context":"Changed Custom Text",
  "RegistryPrefix": "OpenBMC.0.2"
}
```

  5) DeleteSubscription: Client can unsubscribe and stop receiving events
     by deleting the subscription.
```
URI: /redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/<ID>
METHOD: DELETE
```

** Server-Sent events subscription: **

  1) EventListner and Subscription: Client can open latest browser (chrome)
     and fire GET URI on "ServerSentEventUri" along with filters.
```
URI: /redfish/v1/EventService/SSE?RegistryPrefix='OpenBMC.0.2'&MessageId='OpenBMC.0.2.xyz"
METHOD: GET
```
     On successful event subscription client will receive 200(Created) http
     status code, subscription id along with below response headers for
     streaming.
```
'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
'Connection': 'keep-alive'
```
     At this point onwards, client browser will receive events associated with
     subscribed data.

     Client can use "SubmitTestEvent" (Documented above) to test the working
     state.

  2) ViewSubscription: Client can get the subscriptions details using
```
URI: /redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/<ID>
METHOD: GET
```

  3) UpdateSubscription: At any point client can update the subscription
     information.
     Note Client can't change the destination as that is opaque associated with
     opened SSE connection.
```
URI: /redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/<ID>
METHOD: PATCH
REQUEST BODY:
{
  "Context":"Changed Custom Text",
  "RegistryPrefix": "OpenBMC.0.2"
}
```

  4) DeleteSubscription: There are two ways to close the connection from client.
     - Client can close the browser directly which will close the SSE http
       connection and so bmcweb service can close and delete the subscription
       data.
     - Client can also unsubscribe and stop receiving events
       by deleting the subscription.
```
URI: /redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/<ID>
METHOD: DELETE
```

** EventListner **

Push style Events:

To listen the push style events, client can have web server running on any
external system and subscribe to BMC with the subscription details along with
destination URI.

There are multiple EventListners exist and here is simple node js server, which
can be run using "node server.js".
```
// server.js
const http = require("http");
var displayResponse;

http.createServer((request, response) => {
    console.log("Requested url: " + request.url);
    const { headers, method, url } = request;

    if ((method.toLowerCase() == "post") && (url.toLowerCase() === "/events")) {
        let body = [];
        request.on('error', (err) => {
          console.error(err);
        }).on('data', (chunk) => {
          body.push(chunk);
        }).on('end', () => {
          body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();

          console.log(body);
          displayResponse.write(body);
          displayResponse.write("\n\n");

          response.statusCode = 200;
          response.end();
        })
    } else if ((method.toLowerCase() == "get") && (url.toLowerCase() === "/display_events")) {
      response.writeHead(200, {
        Connection: "keep-alive",
        "Content-Type": "text/event-stream",
        "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"
      });

      displayResponse = response;
    } else {
      response.writeHead(404);
      response.end();
    }

Server-Sent Events (SSE):

Client can open an SSE connection to the service by performing a GET
on the URI specified by the "ServerSentEventUri" in the Event Service
along with filters. Browser automatically prompt for credentials and
upon successful completion of authentication and authorization, client
connection will be established for listening events.

You can also refer below link for details on Server-Sent events.
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events)

Another simple python script for testing SSE using EventSource.
Run it using "python sse-client.py".
```
// sse-client.py
import requests, json, sys, time, re, os
import sseclient
from requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions import InsecureRequestWarning
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings(InsecureRequestWarning)
from sseclient import SSEClient

try:
  bmc_ip = sys.argv[1]
  username = sys.argv[2]
  password = sys.argv[3]

except:
  print "FAIL: Usage: <ScriptName> <BMC_IP> <Username> <Password>"
  print "Example: python sseClient.py 10.223.244.145 root root\n"
  sys.exit()


url = 'https://%s/redfish/v1/EventService/SSE?<filters>' %bmc_ip

try:
  messages = SSEClient(url, verify=False, auth=(username, password))

  for msg in messages:
    print(json.dumps(msg.data))

except Exception as exc:
  print("\nERROR: Error in subscribing the SSE events\n")
```

Supported properties:


| PROPERTY NAME              | TYPE        | DESCRIPTION                       |
|----------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| ServiceEnabled | Boolean | This indicates whether event service is enabled. Default: True |
| DeliveryRetryAttempts | Integer | This is the number of attempts an event posting is retried before the subscription is terminated. Default: 3 |
| DeliveryRetryIntervalSeconds | Integer | This represents the number of seconds between retry attempts for sending any given Event. Default: 30        |
| EventFormatTypes | Array(string) |Indicates the content types of the message that this service can send to the event destination. ** Event: ** Resource types of 'Event' sent to subscribed destination. This is default value if nothing is specified. ** MetricReport: ** Resource types of 'MetricReport' only sent to subscribed destination.       |
| RegistryPrefixes | Array(string) | A list of the Prefixes of the Message Registries that can be used for the RegistryPrefix property on a subscription. If this property is absent or contains an empty array, the service does not support RegistryPrefix-based subscriptions. |
| ResourceTypes | Array(string) | A list of the Prefixes of the message registries that can be used for the RegistryPrefix property on a subscription. If this property is absent or contains an empty array, the service does not support RegistryPrefix-based subscriptions |
| ServerSentEventUri | String | The value of this property shall be a URI that specifies an HTML5 Server-Sent Event conformant endpoint. URI: /redfish/v1/EventService/SSE |
| Subscriptions | Object | The value of this property shall contain the link to a collection of type EventDestinationCollection. |
| Actions | Object | This action shall add a test event to the event service with the event data specified in the action parameters. More details on TestEvents captured below. |


Note: EventService.v1_3_0 was created to deprecate the EventTypesForSubscription
      and SSEFilterPropertiesSupported\EventType properties.

## Problem Description

SDR is a data record that provides platform management sensor type, locations,
event generation and access information.

A data records that contain information about the type and the number of sensors
in the platform, sensor threshold support, event generation capabilities and
information on what type of readings the sensor provides.

The primary purpose of Sensor Data Records is to describe the sensor configuration
of the platform management subsystem to system software.

Sensor Data Records also include records describing the number and type of devices
that are connected to the systemâ€™s IPMB, records that describe the location and
type of FRU Devices (devices that contain field replaceable unit information).

The current version of OpenBMC does not have support for SDR design. This design
will provide the support on how SDR information in each IPMB device is received
using IPMB support.

## Background and References

This design is completely based on the IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management
Interface) Specification Second Generation v2.0.

Entity manager supports SDR sensor statically by configuring the sensor details
in json file. This implementation supports SDR dynamically by detecting the
number of IPMB FRU present.

## Requirements

 - Entity manager configuration to support the number of IPMB devices.
 - Dbus-sensors (IpmbSensor) daemon to support SDR sensor information.

## Proposed Design

The below diagram represents the overview for proposed SDR Design.

This document proposes a design for IPMB based SDR implementation.

 - Need to create a configuration file to detect the number of IPMB Devices.

 - Once the IPMB Device is detected, SDR Repository information and the record
   count of the sensor will be identified for each IPMB devices.

 - Reservation ID for SDR sensor will also be received after the record count
   using IPMB support.

 - Data packet will be framed based on the reservation ID to get the full
   information of each sensor like sensor name, sensor type, sensor unit,
   threshold values, sensor unique number using IPMB.

 - After all the information is read, sensor details will be displayed in the
   dbus path under IpmbSensor service.

**Example**

```
ENTITY-MANAGER :

     busctl tree xyz.openbmc_project.EntityManager
     `-/xyz
       `-/xyz/openbmc_project
         |-/xyz/openbmc_project/EntityManager
         `-/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory
          `-/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system
            `-/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board
              |-/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board/<ProbeName>
              | |-/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board/<ProbeName>/1_IpmbDevice
                               ............
                               ............
              |-/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board/<ProbeName>
              | |-/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board/<ProbeName>/N_IpmbDevice

DBUS-SENSORS :

     busctl tree xyz.openbmc_project.IpmbSensor
     `-/xyz
       `-/xyz/openbmc_project
         `-/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors
           `-/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/current
             `-/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/current/sensor1
                         ............
                         ............
           `-/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/power
             `-/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/power/sensor1
                         ............
                         ............
           `-/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature
             `-/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/sensor1
                         ............
                         ............
           `-/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/voltage
             `-/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/voltage/sensor1
```

Following modules will be updated for this implementation.

 - Entity-Manager
 - Dbus-Sensors

## Entity-Manager

A configuration file is created to probe the IPMB FRU devices to detect the
number of the IPMB support present and dbus object path & interface is
created under entity-manager service.

## Dbus-Sensors

**IpmbSensor**

After the interface is created for IPMBDevice in entity-manager, dbus-signal
will be notified to IpmbSensor. For each config, based on the bus index for
each IPMB device, SDR Repository information will be received using IPMB.

This information will provide the number of SDR records and SDR Reservation ID
will be received using IPMB support. Then, data packet will be framed based on
reservation ID to get the full information of each sensor using IPMB.

Once all the sensor information is read, each data will be processed and
displayed in dbus path under IpmbSensor service.

## Impacts

This design does not have any impacts on the existing changes as the code is
implemented based on the IPMB Devices detected in entity-manager.

## Testing
The proposed design is tested in a IPMB based Twinlake platform.

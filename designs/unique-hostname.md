## Problem Description
In OpenBMC, the hostname discovery is done by the avahi Dbus service at the
startup. In a network where there are multiple OpenBMC machines, avahi keeps
getting the hostname conflict and the service name conflict. Hence, the
problem is to find a solution that resolves these conflicts.

## Background and References
The detailed issue regarding the hostname and service name conflicts is
described in the following links.

## Requirements
None.

## Proposed Design
To solve this, we are proposing a service which assigns a unique hostname to
the BMC and runs on the very first boot. one of the ways to generate the unique
hostname is to append the Serial Number retrieved from Inventory Manager to the
existing default hostname.

## Alternatives Considered
None.

## Impacts
None.

## Testing
None.

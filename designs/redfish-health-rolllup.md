## Problem Description

Redfish Status has 3 main properties: Health,
HealthRollup, and State. We need ways to be able to determine from a high level
the health of contained components. We also need to be able to determine the
health of individual components.

## Background and References

HealthRollup contains the combined health for all components below it. Main use
cases are:

- Health of individual sensors applying to health of chassis
- Health of chassis applying to health of bmc
- Health of host applying to system health

The more difficult examples that we need to cover are:

https://<bmc-addr>/redfish/v1/Systems/system/Memory/dimm0, where we need to roll
the health of the dimm up multiple levels to the system health.

https://<bmc-addr>/redfish/v1/Managers/bmc, where we need to get the health of
the bmc with no direct sensors.

https://<bmc-addr>/redfish/v1/Chassis/1Ux16_Riser_1/<sensor-type>, where
multiple sensor types roll up to the chassis health.

https://<bmc-addr>/redfish/v1/Managers/bmc/EthernetInterfaces/eth1, where the
ethernet interface failing needs to contribute to bmc health.

Some examples of health with different use cases are:
- Individual Sensors
- Chassis containing sensors
- Managers/BMC
- System

Currently operational status only has pass / fail options. Where Redfish health
is tri-state:

## Requirements
- Must minimize D-Bus calls needed to get health rollup
- Must minimize new D-Bus objects being created
- Should try to utilize existing D-Bus interfaces

## Proposed Design

### Individual Sensor Health

Map critical thresholds to health critical, and warning thresholds to health
warning. If thresholds do not exist or do not indicate a problem, map
OperationalStatus failed to critical.

### Chassis / System Health

Chassis have individual sensors. Cross reference the individual sensors with
the global health. If any of the sensors of the chassis are in the
global health association for warning, the chassis rollup is warning.
Likewise if any inventory for the chassis is in the global health critical, the
chassis is critical. The global inventory item will be
xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Global.

### Chassis / System Health Rollup

Any other associations ending in "critical" or "warning" are combined, and
searched for inventory. The worst inventory item in the Chassis is the rollup
for the Chassis. System is treated the same.

### Fan example

A fan will be marked critical if its threshold has crossed critical, or its
operational state is marked false. This fan may then be placed in the global
health warning association if the system determines this failure should
contribute as such. The chassis that the fan is in will then be marked as
warning as the inventory that it contains is warning at a global level.

## Alternatives Considered

A new daemon to track global health state. Although this would be difficult
to reuse to track individual component health.

## Impacts


## Testing

Testing will be performed using sensor values and the status LED.

## Problem Description

The current implementation in the phosphor-host-postd supports only single host
postcode access through LPC interface.

As the open BMC architecture is evolving, the single host support becomes
contingent and needs multiple-host post code access to be implemented.

## Background and References

**Existing postcode implementation for single host**

The below component diagram shows the present implementation for postcode and
history at high-level overview

## Requirements

 - Read postcode from all servers.
 - Display the host postcode to the 7 segment display based on host position
   selection.
 - Provide a command interface for user to see any server(multi-host) current
   postcode.
 - Provide a command interface for user to see any server(multi-host) postcode
   history.
 - Support for hot-plug-able host.

## Proposed Design

This document proposes a new design engaging the IPMB interface to read the
port-80 post code from multiple-host. The existing single host LPC interface
remains unaffected. This design also supports host discovery including the
hot-plug-able host connected in the slot.

Following modules will be updated for this implementation

 - phosphor-host-postd.
 - phosphor-post-code-manager.
 - platform specific OEM handler (fb-ipmi-oem).
 - phosphor-dbus-interfaces.
 - bmcweb(redfish logging service).

@@ - Incase of the single host, only process1 runs for host0. For multi-host
     one process will be running per host(multi-process).

```

**Postcode Flow:**

 - BMC power-on the host.
 - Host starts sending the postcode IPMI message continuously to the BMC.
 - The ipmbbridged(phosphor-ipmi-ipmb) extracts postcode from IPMI message.
 - The ipmbd(phosphor-ipmi-host) appends host information with postcode and
   sends to the phosphor-host-postd.
 - phosphor-host-postd sends postcode events to the phosphor-post-code-manager
   and displays postcode in the seven segment display.
 - phosphor-post-code-manager stores the postcode as history in the /var
   directory.

##  Platform Specific OEM Handler (fb-ipmi-oem)

This library is part of the [phosphor-ipmi-host]
(https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid)
and gets the postcode from host through
[phosphor-ipmi-ipmb](https://github.com/openbmc/ipmbbridge).

 - Register IPMI OEM postcode callback handler.
 - Extract postcode from IPMI message (phosphor-ipmi-host/phosphor-ipmi-ipmb).
 - The phosphor-ipmi-host sends extracted postcode to the phosphor-host-postd.

## phosphor-host-postd

This implementation involves the following changes in the phosphor-host-postd.

 - Create D-Bus names for single-host and multi-host system accordingly.
   The community follows conventions Host0 for single host and Host1 to N for
   multi-host.
 - Send event to post-code-manager based on which host's postcode received from
   IPMB interface (xyz.openbmc_project.State.Boot.RawX(0,1,2,3..N).Value).
 - phosphor-host-postd reads the host selection from the dbus property.
 - Display the latest postcode of the selected host read through D-Bus.

 **D-Bus interface**

  The following D-Bus names need to be created for the multi-host post-code.

    Service name      -- xyz.openbmc_project.State.Boot.Raw(0,1,2..N)

    Obj path name     -- /xyz/openbmc_project/State/Boot/Raw

    Interface name    -- xyz.openbmc_project.State.Boot.Raw

    method            -- readPostcode(new method added in
                         phoshpor-dbus-interfaces)

## phosphor-post-code-manager

The phosphor-post-code-manager is a multi service design for multi-host.
The single host postcode handling D-bus naming conventions will be updated
to comply the community naming scheme.

 - Create D-Bus names for single-host and multi-host system accordingly.
   The community follows conventions Host0 for single host and Host1 to N for
   multi-host.
 - Store/retrieve post-code from directory (/var/lib/phosphor-post-code-manager/
   hostX(0,1,2,3..N)) based on event received from phosphor-host-postd

 **D-Bus interface**

   The following D-Bus names needs to be created for multi-host post-code.

    Service name     -- xyz.openbmc_project.State.Boot.PostCodeX(0,1,2..N)

    Obj path name    -- /xyz/openbmc_project/State/Boot/PostCode

    Interface name   -- xyz.openbmc_project.State.Boot.PostCode


## phosphor-dbus-interfaces

  The new method needs to be created to interact between phosphor-host-postd
  and fb-ipmi-oem.

  The new D-Bus method is added in the below path,

  https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/
  xyz/openbmc_project/State/Boot/Raw.interface.yaml.

  methods:

    - name: readPostcode
      description: >
          Method to get the post codes.
      parameters:
        - name: postcode
          type: uint16
          description: >
              postcode indicates which host postcode.
        - name: host
          type: uint16
          description: >
              host indicates host number

## bmcweb
   The postcode history needs to be handled for the multi-host through
   redfish logging service.

## Alternate design

**phosphor-post-code-manager single process approach**

   This implementation consider single service to handle multi-host postcode.
   In this approach, all D-Bus handling will taken care by the single process.

   Single service is different than existing x86-power-control and obmc-console
   where multi-service approach is used.

   Multi-service approach is more scalable to handle multi-host than
   the single service.

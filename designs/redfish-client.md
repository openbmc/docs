## Problem Description

Certain Satellite Management Controllers (SMC), such as Nvidia's HMC, can only
be communicated using the Redfish protocol. Since currently OpenBMC only
provides limited capability of talking Redfish as a client, e.g. bmcweb Redfish
aggregation, BMC applications have no access to resources that are controlled by
such SMC (See alternatives considered session for detailed rationale on why
bmcweb Redfish aggregation is not sufficient). In some cases, having BMC
applications being able to access resources from such SMC is a must. For
example, thermal calibration needs sensor readings from the SMC.

## Requirements

BMC applications are able to perform read and write operations towards resources
controlled by SMC that can only be accessed via Redfish. The operations include
but not limited to:

- Sensor monitoring
- Event log collection
- Hardware and firmware inventory discovery
- Firmware upgrade
- Crash-dump retrieval

For each individual operation, the following aspect should be configurable by
config files and can be system specific:

- Target SMC to communicate with
- Target URL for Redfish requests
- Mapping of Redfish response

Client should produce dbus interfaces that are indistinguishable from normal
resources.

## Proposed Design

### Redfish Client Daemon

This design proposes to develop a Redfish client daemon that will start at BMC
boot time. The daemon then will load all configurations and use compatible ones
to either create a task for read operations or expose proper D-Bus interfaces
and methods for write operations.

The read task will periodically send Redfish requests to the SMC to read
resources, and then map the responses to proper D-Bus objects which can be
inspected by other BMC applications. Depends on the feature, the task will
either host the D-Bus objects directly or call corresponding API provided by
other BMC applications. Each task would maintain an internal state so that the
difference between two reads from SMC can be calculated and be reflected to the
D-Bus objects. Some example as the following:

| Purpose              | Redfish Resource                         | D-Bus path namespace or API                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sensor Monitoring    | Collection of [Sensor][Sensor]           | /xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/                                       |
| Event Log Collection | Collection of [Event][Event]             | [phosphor-logging](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-logging) API |
| Firmware Inventory   | [Software Inventory][Software Inventory] | /xyz/openbmc_project/software/                                      |

[Sensor]:
  https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0268_2024.3.html#sensor-1101
[Event]:
  https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0268_2024.3.html#event-1110
[Software Inventory]:
  https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0268_2024.3.html#softwareinventory-1102

For write operations, the daemon should expose D-Bus interfaces and methods that
conform with the expectation of the BMC application that handles the operation.
For example,
[xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Update](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Software/Update.interface.yaml)
interface would be exposed for other BMC applications to trigger the firmware
upgrade, and the actual implementation would conform with design for
[code update](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/designs/code-update.md).

All the configuration files (each of them targeted different SMC or same SMC but
different compatible component/device) should reside within one directory that
are close to the Redfish client source code. For each configuration, the
following trait should be able to be specified if applicable:

- The compatible component/device, using
  [Compatible](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Decorator/Compatible.interface.yaml)
  D-Bus interface
- The target SMC, which should refer to a
  [SatelliteController](https://github.com/openbmc/entity-manager/blob/e25a3890392093fec8f49b84c5bbce99055c6768/schemas/satellite_controller.json)
  exposed by an entity in entity manager configuration
- The target Redfish URL
- The cadence of sending Redfish requests for read task
- The mapping from Redfish responses to D-Bus objects, such as sensor name
  mapping and message id mapping

### Redfish Library

This design also proposes to develop a Redfish library that can do codegen from
Redfish schemas to C++ classes. This is similar to DMTF
[Redfish-Schema-C-Struct-Generator](https://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Schema-C-Struct-Generator)
but it generates mordern c++ code rather than c code with raw pointers and
char\*. Every Redfish schema will have one corresponding C++ class generated
with the following feature supported:

- An instance of that class can be constructed from a JSON object (string) that
  conforms to that Redfish schema
- An instance of that class can be converted to a JSON object (string) that
  conforms to that Redfish schema
- Metadata specified in Redfish schema should be made accessible, such as the
  description of each properties
- Containing "error" property where expected error can be capctured
- Containing "leftover" property to capcture invalid keys and values so that the
  caller can decide how to handle them

This library would provide decent statically-typed class abstraction of the
Redfish data model for the Redfish client daemon so that direct validation and
manipulation towards raw json objects can be prevented. On the other hand, the
business logic of how to make Redfish query and how to manipulate those Redfish
objects are out of the scope of this library but reside on the daemon side.

There is also significant interest within Meta to utilize this library for
internal tooling, which would likely result in rapid iteration and the inclusion
of additional Redfish features and bug fixes. This could lead to a more robust
and feature-rich library that benefits both internal and external users.

## Future work

- Support Redpath
- Enable Event subscription to the SMC
- Adopt OpenBMC Http Library if it is being merged and implemented upstream
- Better ide support for codegen

## Alternatives Considered

### Redfish Aggregation

It is possible to leverage redfish aggregation on
[bmcweb](https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/AGGREGATION.md) to enable
external access of the SMC, but there are some limitation and development
overhead.

The following features can be fulfilled by a Redfish client, but are challenging
to support with Redfish aggregation:

- Enabling Applications within BMC to Access SMC Resources
  - Thermal Calibration: "phosphor-pid-control" requires sensor values from SMC
    as input for the fan control algorithm.
  - Sensor Threshold Monitoring: Some SMC vendors do not implement sensor
    threshold monitoring; the BMC must obtain sensor values from the SMC to
    perform monitoring and emit event logs accordingly.
- Middle Layer Control for SMC Resource Exposure: A middle layer within the BMC
  controls how SMC resources are exposed outside the BMC, decoupling
  SMC-vendor-flavored Redfish from tooling outside the BMC.
  - Provide a unified flavor of Redfish to ensure that external tooling can
    interact seamlessly with both SMC and BMC implementations, thereby avoiding
    the need for duplicated development efforts and reducing overall development
    costs.
  - Change Management: Ensures that changes in the SMC do not require every
    single downstream tool to change accordingly. For example:
    - Suppose there is a sensor named X controlled by SMC and multiple
      downstream tools depend on it to function correctly.
    - At some point, the SMC vendor decides to rename sensor X to Y.
    - If the sensor X is directly exposed as it is, then all of the downstream
      tools need to change because the vendor just changed X to Y.
    - However, if there is a middle layer that has some sort of configuration to
      map sensor X to X*, changing that configuration to Y to X* should be good
      enough to make sure all the downstream tools can still function properly
      with the updated SMC.
  - Early Detection of SMC Changes: Captures SMC changes, such as sensor name
    changes, during the BMC firmware validation phase, rather than later in the
    process.
  - Some resources or data generated by the SMC may not be intended for external
    exposure outside of the BMC.
    - For example, not exposing Redfish OEM commands helps prevent external
      tools from depending on them, thereby avoiding compatibility issues that
      may arise since these commands are specific to certain systems or firmware
      versions.

The following features can be fulfilled by a Redfish client and could
potentially be fulfilled by Redfish Aggregation as well, but with additional
development work:

- Redfish URIs generated by the SMC need to be accessible outside of the BMC.
  - There is existing logic within bmcweb's Redfish Aggregation to adjust the
    URIs returned by the SMC. However, this logic may need to be extended to
    handle cases where "messageArgs" could contain URIs.
- Event Service Support: Events emitted by the SMC should be pushed to the event
  subscriber if there is any at the time of generation.
- Multi-SMC Support

Implementing the above features using Redfish Aggregation would require
significant development effort. In contrast, a Redfish client can provide these
capabilities out-of-the-box.

There is also a security concern associated with utilizing Redfish aggregation,
which involves exposing the SMC directly to the external network and potentially
presenting SMC security vulnerabilities externally. The update cadence for the
SMC may be decoupled from that of the BMC, so while any vulnerabilities might be
fixed rapidly for a BMC, it may take a much longer time for a fix to be
developed and deployed to SMCs.

### Implement Redfish client within corresponding feature repositories

Rather than having a redfish client daemon that supports multiple features, an
alternative would be to put sensor support into dbus-sensors, firmware update
support into phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt, and logging support into phosphor-logging
etc. The problem with this approach is that the Redfish client implementation
would need to be duplicated across multiple repositories, resulting in increased
maintenance efforts and complexity when making horizontal changes, such as
adding new Redfish authentication methods or implementing security-related
patches, because in such case changes would need to be made in multiple
repositories. In addition, [pldm](https://github.com/openbmc/pldm) utilizes a
similar approach where pldmd is the centralized daemon that talks pldm and
supports multiple features like firmware update and bios control.

### Configuration

Rather than having separate configuration files, an alternative could be to
expand the configuration options for the
[SatelliteController](https://github.com/openbmc/entity-manager/blob/e25a3890392093fec8f49b84c5bbce99055c6768/schemas/satellite_controller.json)
to meet the need of Redfish client daemon. The only problem with this approach
is that this would make the configuration always tied to the entity that exposes
the satellite controller, which makes it impossible to tune the configuration
between different machines but contains that same entity.

### Direct manipulation of json object

Instead of relying on the Redfish Library to generate C++ classes for Redfish
resources, we could have the daemon directly manipulate JSON objects. However,
this approach would result in hard-coded string literals scattered throughout
the codebase, making it difficult to maintain and prone to errors as the project
scales. A single typo in one of these string literals would only be caught at
runtime when the actual Redfish resource is being serialized or deserialized. In
contrast, using proper class abstractions on top of the JSON objects can prevent
such issues and enable compile-time checks, ensuring greater reliability and
maintainability.

## Impacts

Despite developers needing to write additional configuration files to enable the
Redfish client feature, no API changes for other BMC applications.

If there is no SMC that the Redfish client daemon needs to talk to, it should
have minimal impact. If the Redfish client daemon is configured to pull data
from the SMC, it may consume some CPU time of the BMC but should be a reasonable
amount.

A new repo will be created within the organization. A new recipe will be added
to OpenBMC. There will be additional documentation within the new repo but this
design would be the starting point.

Primary dependencies:

- libcurl
- nlohmann/json
- openbmc/sdbusplus

## Organizational

### Does this design require a new repository?

Yes, a new repository is required for both the daemon, configuration files and
the library.

### Who will be the initial maintainer(s) of this repository?

Patrick Williams.

## Testing

### Unit Testing

Having unit tests to validate all of the code paths that will be implemented as
mentioned in the design.

### Integration Testing

Using openbmc-test-automation to run end to end integration tests to validate
the code generated from Redfish client library is as expected and the Redfish
client daemon is able to read configuration files to create corresponding tasks
and D-bus objects.

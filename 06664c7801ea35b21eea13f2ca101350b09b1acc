      "message": "In addition to the design, I also updated the requirements and problem description so that the story is more consistent. Michael has concerns that this new requirements will not be taken by upstream so I started a new one. To make it easier to read, I removed the common parts in this change and keep only the parts that needs to be reviewed.\n\nFrom the implementation perspective, the main difference is that this design focuses on recording actual events instead of predefining a table. Thus, no need to maintain the state machine transition table.",

This doesn\u0027t seem accurate.  All i2c devices are pretty likely to share wrappers around libi2c.  What you\u0027re saying is also the opposite of what we\u0027ve seen in dbus-sensors with regards to VRs, where the majority of code is common, and only the last few lines of the specific commands changes per device, while the transports retries, etc all remain the same.  How did you come to the conclusion that the per-device code would differ significantly?\n\n\u003e as only shared piece will be the DBus interface which already reside in a common repository (phosphor-dbus-interfaces).

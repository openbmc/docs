      "message": "Overall, I think there\u0027s a design here that could work.  As a general theme, this doc has lots of tangents into unrelated topics that could be removed, which would improve the design considerably.\n\nOne thing that I think this doc is missing is a layout of how the system connections will go on dbus.  Considering these are sensors that cannot be exposed outside the system, it\u0027s not clear how ipmi/redfish can know that those sensors shouldn\u0027t be exposed outside the box.\n\nIt also isn\u0027t clear how this integrates with the aggregation work that\u0027s already been done to make redfish trees forwardable through the system.",

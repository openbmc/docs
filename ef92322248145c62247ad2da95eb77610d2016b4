The smaller box contains critical components, and all we have from the vendor is an embedded Redfish server providing us with temperature readings. Our large box has fans, under our control, and we are responsible for keeping that smaller box cool during operation. The smaller box has no cooling ability of its own, and it\u0027s our fans that blow on it, so we have to know the temperature of it, via these Redfish readings, in order to regulate our fans.",

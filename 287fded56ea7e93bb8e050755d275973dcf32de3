This means that everyone needs to cross review everyone elses design doc and come to a conclusion on what the superset of what we need is, who is going to execute on what portions, and how we\u0027re going to make it interop across the various things that need it.",

Current software update daemon follows this custom tool logic only. This design doc specifies only this custom tool design and implementation and not specific to firmware update.\n\nphosphor-ipmi-flash - This is different, It uses the BLOB protocol to transfer the firmware image. It follows the commands based on BlockTransfer. But Ours is more specific to IPMI OEM commands which has OEM based netfn and cmds for requesting firmware update and image transferring. So, we cannot use phosphor-ipmi-flash.",

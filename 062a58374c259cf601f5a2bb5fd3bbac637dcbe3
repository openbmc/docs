      "message": "There are two additional io_uring efforts going on that I\u0027m aware of.\n\n1. wak was adding io_uring support to sdeventplus, right?  How does that fit into this effort?  Shouldn\u0027t we mention it here?\n\n2. As part of introducing coroutines to sdbusplus, I\u0027ve been experimenting with libunifex.  Parts of libunifex are likely to be merged into std in C++23.  libunifex also has support for io_uring on Linux.\n\nHopefully this effort you are proposing will not be interacting with io_uring directly...",

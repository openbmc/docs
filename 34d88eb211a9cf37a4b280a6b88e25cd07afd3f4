Can you outline what the goal is here, and who is taking responsibility for getting at least some of the codebase up to the standard.",

      "message": "Is it your intention to get these passing across a subset of the project, or just to enable the tests?  (please answer in your commit message).  This commit functionally is only documentation which is good to get consensus (which I think we have), now what\u0027s the plan for the actual refactoring work?\n\nA couple things of note that I see in the ipmbridge patchset now:\n\nThe NOLINTBEGIN directives themselves only show the tidy check that failed, and don\u0027t make it very obvious which parameter of the test actually failed.  It took me a good bit of looking to be able to tell that some NOLINT directives were for extra params.  Also, NOLINTBEGIN and NOLINTEND make more of a mess than I would\u0027ve thought.  Does NOLINT not work?  Can we not refactor these functions?  This makes me worried about the readability being worse with that param enabled.  I would probably advocate for removing the param limit for the moment until we can solve these issues, and come up with a strategy for refactoring.\n\nMore importantly ipmbbridge is so little code, and is already relatively structured, that I\u0027m not sure we\u0027re doing ourselves a service picking it as an example.  It\u0027s also not run on very many platforms, so it\u0027s not a great place to start to look at how many bugs we cause as part of these refactoring.  It\u0027s likely that any bugs we inject wouldn\u0027t be found for a very long time (as has happened in the past) and we don\u0027t get enough code reviews on that project to see how it effects code submissions that violate these rules.",

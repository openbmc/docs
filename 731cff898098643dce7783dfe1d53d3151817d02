      "message": "In this case, in my opinion, the direct readability takes a lower precedence to code reviews and diffs.  For long lambdas, with Signature set on this, any change to the lambda signature would cause a large diff, as the code below it got re-wrapped in odd ways, which would show up as many lines of change for what amounted to a minor change.  This more than once caused bugs, because we couldn\u0027t effectively review what had changed.\n\nIt should also be noted that the clang-format documentation specifically calls out \"callback-heavy code\" of which I think most asio daemons would qualify.\n\nIdeally there would be an \"OuterScope + 1\" setting, which would give both readability through indent, as well as clean diffs, but so far as I know, that doesn\u0027t exist.\n\nI\u0027m in support of this patchset as it\u0027s written.",

I try to describe the problems instead of the implementations.\n\nDuring a server reboot/power cycle process, measuring the duration spent on each [stage](#definition-of-each-stage) is the key to profiling and monitoring the software quality. However, some parts of the flow are not easy to be measured and exposed to host user space applications. For example, it\u0027s impossiblt to measure the time spent on Linux kernel shutting down because the file system might be unavailable at the end of kernel reboot process.",

However, in some cases, tray power cycle reboot flow actually shut BMC and host down at the same time. This is may be by design. It would be nice to have a short subsection that mentioned this case explicitly. However, like you mentioned, actually this is defined in `unexpected power cycle`. It\u0027s just a bit unclear to the reader that the expected shutdown flow is explained in `unexpected power cycle`.",

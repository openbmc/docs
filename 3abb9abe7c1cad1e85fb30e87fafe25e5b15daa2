      "message": "If this set of devices is not just \"all I2C devices\" then can you please provide a small list of existing devices of interest with accompanying discussion about their specific behaviours that demonstrates the need for this proposal? Also provide a small list of devices where this daemon\u0027s behaviour isn\u0027t required. Let\u0027s make things concrete. And some discussion about how to prevent these devices being automatically monitored by e.g. dbus-sensors if that\u0027s simultaneously in use on the system?\n\nIf this set of devices turns out to be \"all I2C devices\", then I suspect you have a pretty big uphill battle on your hands, as it will need to reimplement existing projects like dbus-sensors. It will be contentious at least due to community fragmentation (we already have enough of this).",

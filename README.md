# OpenBMC documentation

The [OpenBMC project](https://www.openbmc.org/) is a Linux Foundation project
whose goal is to produce a customizable, open-source firmware stack for
Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs). This repository contains documentation
for OpenBMC as a whole. There may be component-specific documentation in the
repository for each component.

The [features](features.md) document lists the project's major features with
links to more information.

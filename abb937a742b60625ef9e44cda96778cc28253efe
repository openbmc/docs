      "message": "I agree with the goal \"to make the code more readable\"\n\nI worry, that enforcing arbitrary limits will not help. strict adherence to this rules will not necessarily facilitate cleaner code.\n\nOne can imagine \n- Splitting one logical function multiple time, so it complies with with 60 line rule. \n- Or packing all 8 parameters into a onetime use structs to get around the 7 parameter limit. \n- Or dumping cyclomatic complexity into a library,\n\n\nA strong system of ownership and reviewers keeps code clean, and maintainable. I would perfer not to limit either the maintainers or the devs in such a strict way",

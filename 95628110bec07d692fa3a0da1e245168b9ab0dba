Any specific reason for bmcweb to directly communicate with PLDMd?\nNote: \nThis will cause certain limitations\n1. Full image update level support will require changes in bmcweb (relying on phosphor-software-manager will not have this issue)\n2. what if BMC level image verification is required for certain devices?\n\nBasically, irrespective of whether the device uses Pldm or any other methodologies, the update mechanism from BMC must stand same, the diversification etc. must happen in terms of phosphor-software-manager and not in bmcweb.\nE.g. Whether BIOS is updated as normal image or PLDM model, flow from bmcweb must remain the same, and phosphor-software-manager, after doing image verification etc, and based on the header it can direct the required update mechanism (i.e. if it is PLDM request to PLDM daemon).",

      "message": "Richard - What is exposed to bmcweb is a D-Bus API. This design is not proposing a change to how bmcweb activates firmware for PLDM images (please see details below in the description section). So, I am not sure I followed your concern. I don\u0027t think there is a guideline/reason that one application must house all varying implementations of a D-Bus API. For eg - bmcweb queries sensors/FRUs via well-known D-BUs APIs. Such sensor/FRU D-Bus objects can be housed by multiple daemons (that\u0027s the whole premise of having standard D-Bus APIs and bmcweb using mapper to find objects). In fact my concern with what you described above is we need phosphor-software-manager to deal with PLDM specifics - I want to avoid that.",

      "message": "@Deepak- Agree with your flow on the pldmd and bmcweb on FirmwareInventory flow. \n\nHowever, for the update flow, we think having the \"item manager\" functionality implemented in phosphor-software-manager would provide different BMC vendors to handle the update package the way they deem fit, and pldmd would still have the \"item updater\" functionality. Ex - A PLDM update package can be a signed one. Signature verification can be done in phosphor-software-manager. Phosphor-software-manager could also probe and find out the type of update package sent down by the user using some sort of meta-data like manifest file or probing into image headers.[Image could BMC/BIOS or others like PLDM/PSU/CPLD].\n\nIn the case of PLDM, we have a notion of IMAGE SET versioning. The PLDM update package could have multiple components targeted for multiple FDs (described in figure 6 of the spec). A typical use case could be A NIC vendor providing a single PLDM update package for different SKUs of a single generation of cards; the update package would have different component images targeting different FDs (that may or may not be in the server). The IMAGE SET version could be a good candidate for the phosphor-software-manager\u0027s version interface, and p-s-m could also host the update package\u0027s activation and activation-progress interface. The bmcweb user ,who initiated the update package, could get overall progress wrt to the entire bundle\u0027s update status.\n\nThus, in short, p-s-m can take care of vendor specific implementations like signature verification and host the version interface (based on the IMAGE SET version for pldm update package),activation and activation progress interface, and then place the PLDM only update package in a staging area (/tmp/images/pldm may be) which is compliant to Figure 6 in the spec. It could proceed to make a method call (from fwupd script ot any other mechanism) to pldmd with filepath of the PLDM only update package (if required, we could also pass the d-bus service name/object who is hosting the activation, activation-progress interfaces). \n\nFor pldmd, the update package is self descriptive and would be able to parse the headers and findout the intendent recipient of the update package (using the Device descriptors area) and then proceed with the update flow. It can update the activation state and progress interfaces hosted by p-s-m accordingly.\n\nThe advantage with this method is that pldmd would remain pure \"protocol\" daemon and customizations required by different vendors do not creep into pldmd.",

My concerns with the alternate approach are:\n- p-s-m needs to know about specific firmware update packages format, or we need to come up with additional manifest files and image purpose fields and p-s-m needs to know and maintain information that a certain image was PSU/BIOS/PLDM, etc.\n- Every item updater must provide/implement a D-Bus API for p-s-m to call into, at least to kick start activation and provide information about the objects implementing the version interface, activation interface, progress interface, etc.\n- Since pldm will not own the activation objects, creating associations with inventory objects becomes complex. We would need to provide more details on how the D-Bus APIs would look like.\n- while this approach claims that p-s-m is doing the imagemanager, in reality that image and version management has to be done by pldmd as well (for things like downstream devices).",

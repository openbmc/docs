      "message": "why? So far we are using Phosphor-software-manager to do the update? Any specific reason for bmcweb to directly communicate with PLDMd?\nNote: \nThis will cause certain limitations\n1. Full image update level support will require changes in bmcweb (relying on phosphor-software-manager will not have this issue)\n2. what if BMC level image verification is required for certain devices?\n\nBasically, irrespective of whether the device uses Pldm or any other methodologies, the update mechanism from BMC must stand same, the diversification etc. must happen in terms of phosphor-software-manager and not in bmcweb.\nE.g. Whether BIOS is updated as normal image or PLDM model, flow from bmcweb must remain the same, and phosphor-software-manager, after doing image verification etc, and based on the header it can direct the required update mechanism (i.e. if it is PLDM request to PLDM daemon).",

      "message": "Richard - What is exposed to bmcweb is a D-Bus API. This design is not proposing a change to how bmcweb activates firmware for PLDM images (please see details below in the description section). So, I am not sure I followed your concern. I don\u0027t think there is a guideline/reason that one application must house all varying implementations of a D-Bus API. For eg - bmcweb queries sensors/FRUs via well-known D-BUs APIs. Such sensor/FRU D-Bus objects can be housed by multiple daemons (that\u0027s the whole premise of having standard D-Bus APIs and bmcweb using mapper to find objects). In fact my concern with what you described above is we need phosphor-software-manager to deal with PLDM specifics - I want to avoid that.",

The BMC code udpate could host an /xyz/openbmc_project/software/bmc_image_target. The webserver could from this API make corresponding HTTP push targets.\n\nWe might have to deal with a case where the user pushes a \u0027single image\u0027 package to the BMC. In this scenario we might need bmcweb or some other entity to split the singe image and copy contained images into relevant staging areas.\n\nI will discuss your thoughts on this on Discord.",

However, additional things can be taken care of:\n\n1) The update package could target multiple FDs and each of those FDs could have only a subset of component images applicable to them. \nIn section 7.1 of DSP0267 v1.1 describes this. Thus we could potentially loop over the list of FD, and update all the matched FDs before we proceed with the activation step.\n\n2) There could be multiple instances of the FD in the system (ex: multiple NIC cards from the same vendor would have same FDs). Are we going to update only the inventory item targeted by *HttpPushUri* ?\n\nAlso this section could benefit from a flow diagram describing UA - FD interactions, I think.",

I\u0027m having trouble picturing it based on what you wrote in the commit message.\n\nAlso, in terms of rollout, is this:\n1. Something that\u0027s going to require code changes for every repository.\n2. Something that only effects a minority of repositories doing strange things.\n4. Something that doesn\u0027t change any existing code, just a config file.\n\nNot that we wouldn\u0027t merge it if it\u0027s in the #1 category above, just that we might want to signal boost it a little more if a lot of peoples patchsets in review are about to break.\n",

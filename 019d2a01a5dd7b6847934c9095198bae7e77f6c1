      "message": "I was excited at the start of the doc to see reference to using BootProgress as that\u0027s a generic d-bus property that anyone can update. For example, on our IBM systems, we utilize PLDM as the communication protocol between the BMC and Host. That path updates the BootProgress property. Is there a way to at least make a generic D-Bus property here that could be updated by IPMI or PLDM so others could utilize this function? Or maybe xyz/openbmc_project/Time/Boot is the generic object that BootProgress OR IPMI OEM could update?",
